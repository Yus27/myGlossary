However, the traditional way of interpreting GPR data involves considerable manpower and is time-consuming. The aim of this study is to illustrate a new approach to recognize GPR images of RC structure voids automatically. Firstly, synthetic GPR images are created by FDTD method. As multiple waves caused by steel bars seriously interfere with the target echo signals, it is difﬁcult to identify targets from the forward modeling images. According to the periodicity of multiple waves from steel bars, the predictive deconvolution method is used to suppress those waves and the outcome is preferable. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is proposed to automatically recognize voids in GPR images. The automatic identiﬁcation procedure includes four steps: 1) collecting training data, 2) extracting features from GPR images, 3) building the SVM model and 4) identifying the voids automatically. The results show that the proposed method provides a suitable tool to locate the cover depths and lateral ranges of the voids, and the trained SVM model gives a favorable outcome when noise (no more than 5%) is added to a synthetic GPR image. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction For reinforced concrete (RC) structures such as road pavements, bridges, tunnels and dams, internal voids are the most common defects and can cause harm to the structures. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), for its non-destructive, continuous, rapid, efﬁcient and convenient properties, is considered to be one of the most effective detection methods (Diamanti and Redman, 2012; Kadioglu and Ulugergerli, 2012; Solla et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010). However, as high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) wave is used in GPR detections, multiple reﬂections will appear between embedded steel bars and concrete interface. In time proﬁle, multiple wave and target reﬂection superpose each other, which decreases the quality of GPR image severely and interferes with the judgment and identiﬁcation of voids in GPR images. In the fact that steel bars embedded in RC structures are at regular intervals, multiple waves will repeat periodically in a time proﬁle. Therefore, the predictive deconvolution method is suitable for suppressing multiple waves (Kim et al., 2007; Porsani and Sauck, 2007). At present, the interpretation of GPR data is done mainly by skilled operators. But when it comes to large amount of data, manual handling is apparently powerless. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to study on automatic recognition algorithm, which can not only increase the efﬁciency of interpretation work, but also remove subjective factors ⁎ Corresponding author.

Pattern recognition is one of the most important branches of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). It divides patterns into different particular classes based on the characteristic expression and model division methods. Thus, it can meet the requirement of automatic identiﬁcation for GPR images, which means that targets can be recognized by computer program automatically according to the characteristics of GPR signals (Cui et al., 2010). The support vector machine (SVM) is one of the methods for pattern recognition and has been applied to GPR image recognition recently. In the literatures, there are several published works dealing with the SVM. Wu et al. (2008) used GPR to detect cavities under a railway subgrade, and SVM was applied to identify traces from cavity reﬂections. The results showed that this approach reached a high recognition rate. Later, Wu et al. (2009) used SVM to identify landmines in GPR images and reached an accuracy of 85%. Pasolli et al. (2009) applied SVM to identify the location, size, shape and material property of buried objects form GPR images. Though the results were preferable, the feature extraction method was too complex. Ehret (2010) compared the SVM and artiﬁcial neural network approaches in identifying the location of rock layer from radar images and the SVM showed a better performance in recognition rate. Shao et al. (2010) detected railway subgrade by a GPR system, and then used the SVM algorithm to classify the ballast types successfully. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel method for automatic recognition for GPR images of RC structure voids. First,  126  X. Xie et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 99 (2013) 125–134  GPR detection of RC structure voids is simulated using FDTD method and the effect of multiple waves on synthetic GPR images is discussed. According to the periodical characteristic of multiple waves, the predictive deconvolution method is applied to suppress them. Then, the SVM algorithm is used to identify voids in GPR images. After the procedure of acquiring training data, extracting features, building and training SVM model, the voids in GPR images can be automatically recognized.  Table 1 Parameters for FDTD simulation.

Forward simulation and analysis of GPR images for RC structure voids Synthetic GPR images is generated by means of the electromagnetic simulator “GPRMAX” (Giannopoulos, 2005), which was developed on the basis of FDTD numerical method. Taking a road tunnel structure for an example, the tunnel lining is usually made of reinforced concrete and of tens of centimeters thick. Behind the lining lays the stratum, such as rock or soil. Defects such as voids might be located in the tunnel lining, on the interface between the tunnel lining and the surrounding stratum, or behind the tunnel lining in the rock. The established simulation model is shown in Fig. 1. The dimensions are 3.0 × 2.6 m. The model consists of three layers: 0.2-meter-thick air (εr = 1.0, σ = 0), 0.6-meter-thick concrete (εr = 9.0, σ = 0.01) and 1.8-meter-thick rock (εr = 4.0, σ = 0.01). Three voids are embedded in the model. The sizes are 0.2 × 0.2 m, 0.6 × 0.15 m and 0.4 × 0.4 m respectively. The corresponding burial depths are 0.2 m, 0.45 m and 1.0 m. Four different types of steel bar layout are designed: 1) no steel bar in concrete; 2) steel bars located in upper layer of concrete, spacing  0.35 m; 3) steel bars located in both upper and lower layers of concrete, spacing 0.35 m; 4) steel bars located in both upper and lower layers of concrete, spacing 0.25 m. The four cases are shown in Fig. 1. Parameters for FDTD simulation are listed in Table 1 and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2. It is indicated from the above results that, when there is no steel bars in concrete, the reﬂections of voids in GPR image are distinct, and the interface between concrete and rock is distinguishable (Fig. 2a). When steel bars are located only in the upper layer of concrete, reﬂections of voids embedded in concrete and on the interface between concrete and rock are still distinct. The interface between concrete and rock is distinguishable. But reﬂections of the void in the rock are disturbed slightly by multiples caused by steel bars (Fig. 2b). When two layers of steel bars exist in concrete, the interface between concrete and rock cannot be seen anymore due to the strong reﬂection from the lower layer of steel bars. Besides, reﬂections from the void in the rock become weaker (Fig. 2c). When the spacing of  Fig. 1. Simulation models: (a) No steel bar in concrete. (b) Steel bars located in upper layer of concrete, spacing 0.35 m. (c) Steel bars located in both upper and lower layers of concrete, spacing 0.35 m.

Simulation results: (a) No steel bar in concrete. (b) Steel bars located in upper layer of concrete, spacing 0.35 m. (c) Steel bars located in both upper and lower layers of concrete, spacing 0.35 m. (d) Steel bars located in both upper and lower layers of concrete, spacing 0.25 m.  steel bars is reduced to 0.25 m, the whole image is contaminated by steel bar reﬂections and their multiples. Reﬂections from the void in the rock are seriously disturbed and the interface between concrete and rock disappeared (Fig. 2d). The analysis above shows that, steel bars in RC structures seriously interfere with the reﬂections of voids. The impact of multiple waves is greater to the signals in deep layers. The more steel bars are, the greater the impact of multiple waves is. Therefore, how to effectively suppress multiple waves in GPR image for RC structures is an urgent issue both in signal processing and in auto-recognition stages. The next section will discuss this problem.  The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is called prediction error, shown in Eq. (2). εðt þ α Þ ¼ xðt þ α Þ−x^ðt þ α Þ  3. Multiple wave suppression based on predictive deconvolution The multiple waves caused by steel bars have a negative impact on target recognition in GPR images. That is because electromagnetic waves will diffract when they meet intensive reinforcements during the detection of RC structures. Also, the multiple reﬂections will occur between steel reinforcements and concrete interface, which will lead to many multiple waves recorded by GPR. As the cover depth of steel bars in a RC structure is usually constant, the multiple waves caused by steel bars in the radar proﬁle appear periodically. Thus, according to the periodicity of the multiple waves, it is appropriate to suppress them by taking the predictive deconvolution method. The suppression of multiple waves by predictive deconvolution actually belongs to the inverse ﬁltering issue. According to the past values x(t-1), x(t-2), …, x(t-m) and the present value x(t) of a signal, a predictive factor c(t) can be designed to predict the value at some time t + α in the future through a convolutional operation given below.  x^ðt þ α Þ ¼ cðt Þxðt Þ ¼  m X τ¼0  cðτÞxðt−τÞ  ð1Þ Fig. 3.

To solve the matrix we can get the predictive factor c(t) then the predicted value x^ðt þ α Þ. In a GPR signal, x^ðt þ α Þ is a multiple wave. Therefore, the target reﬂection can be calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the actual value, which is given in Eq. (2). The procedure of suppressing multiple waves caused by steel bars is illustrated in Fig. 3. Predictive step a and operator length m are two important factors in the predictive deconvolution method. An accurate judgment for the initial position of the ﬁrst reﬂection wave is also necessary, or  Fig. 5.

SVM ﬁnds a hyperplane to achieve maximum separation of sample groups.  effective waves might be ﬁltered out and noise might be generated. In order to make the values of a and m more reasonable, the autocorrelation of radar wavelets is introduced into this research. As radar records have a similar character with radar wavelets, their autocorrelation and amplitude spectrum are similar too. Thus, the autocorrelation of radar records can be used to ﬁnd the period of multiple waves, and then a and m can be determined. It is recommended that a is preferable when it is equal to the period of multiple waves, meanwhile m should  be larger than this period. Fig. 4 is an example showing how the two factors are determined and the result of the predictive deconvolution. In a RC structure, the thickness of the concrete cover is only a few centimeters and the spacing of steel bars is intensive. This will result in the superposition of multiple waves, which makes it difﬁcult to extract multiple waves. Thus, we need to keep on trying to make a better determination of those two factors and obtain an ideal ﬁltering effect.  Fig. 7. The procedures to build a SVM model.  130  X. Xie et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 99 (2013) 125–134  4. Automatic recognition for GPR images based on SVM The recognition for GPR images of RC structure voids is to divide reﬂections into two parts, one with void information and the other without. So the SVM algorithm, which is specialized for dealing with binary classiﬁcation problems, will be appropriate for GPR image recognition. 4.1. The basic concept of SVM algorithm A common case of a binary classiﬁcation issue is shown in Fig. 6. There are two groups of samples in a low-dimensional space. They are linearly inseparable, meaning that we cannot ﬁnd a hyperplane to separate the two groups. The basic concept of the SVM algorithm is, ﬁrst, to map the low-dimensional samples into a high-dimensional space through a nonlinear function Φ, which makes most of the samples linearly separable; then, to ﬁnd a hyperplane to separate the two groups to the maximal margin (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). This hyperplane is called the optimal hyperplane. The optimal hyperplane must satisfy the following equation. Fig. 8. Simulation model for training data.

This is a minimum problem under constrain conditions, which is called a convex quadratic programming problem. Then a Lagrange function can be established to transform the minimum problem into its dual problem given below.  Fig. 5 shows the GPR images before and after the suppression of multiple waves using predictive deconvolution. Here, a is set to 11 ns and m is set to 6.5 ns. The result indicates that, the multiple waves from steel bars have been obviously removed and the reﬂection waves of voids have also been enhanced. Meanwhile, we can easily recognize the interface between concrete and rock. Therefore, the predictive deconvolution method allows a successful suppression of multiple waves from steel bars.

In this paper, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation and fourth root of fourth moment are selected as features (Shihab et al., 2002) for they can produce a good discrimination between signals returned from targets and other non-useful ones. Here, standard deviation is given by Eq. (10), mean absolute deviation by Eq. (11) and fourth moment by Eq. (12).  Table 3 Classiﬁcation accuracy of SVM using different kernels.

The kernel function of the SVM algorithm has to satisfy Mercer theorem (Cheriet et al., 2005). At present, linear function (Eq. (13)), polynomial function (Eq. (14)), radial basis function (RBF) (Eq. (15)) and sigmoid function (Eq. (16)) are commonly used functions and have nice properties (Zhang, 2012).

Automatic recognition for GPR images using SVM 4.2.1. Training data acquisition and feature extraction Training data is obtained through FDTD simulation. A three-layer simulation model with one void in it is built, as is shown in Fig. 8. Three parameters are selected to describe the void, including the burial depth D, thickness T and lateral range R. Ten different simulation models are built by assigning different values to the three parameters. The ten cases are listed in Table 2. In these models, steel bars are not included to keep training data clean. Extracting features from GPR images is a two-step task. First, as is shown in Fig. 9, each trace of a GPR image is segmented with a segment length of nd. After segmentation, there usually exists a residual part with the length of nl, which is less than nd. There are no restraints on the length of a segment but operator's experiences are needed to optimize the segmentation. The guiding principle is that the length should be short enough and the subpart contains enough information of a void reﬂection. Therefore, the segmentation is a manual task, and the segment length of one trace might be different from another. In this way, a total number of 42,539 segments are obtained from the ten simulated models. pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Second, σ, MAD and 4 M4 of each segment are calculated as its which can be stored in a vector written as xi ¼ three features, pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ σ i ; MADi ; 4 M4 i . Meanwhile, a tag yi is assigned to xi to indicate the type of each segment. yi = 1 means that the segment is a reﬂection from a void; while yi = 0 means that it is not. Thus, each segment can be expressed by a vector Ti = {xi,yi} called a training sample. For example, a segment from a void is expressed as Ti = {xi = [0.5658 0.4571 0.6847], yi = 1}; another segment from non-void is expressed as Tj = {xj = [0.0069 0.0057 0.0081], yj = 0}. After feature extraction from all GPR images that simulated for training, 42,539 training samples are acquired, including 185 samples with void information and 42,354 samples without. Then 185 samples are chosen from those non-void training samples randomly, together with the samples that contain void information, a training data set that has a total number of 370 samples is formed. Note that in this training data acquisition stage, operators' knowledge and skills are needed. They should ﬁrst judge how long each segment is, and then decide whether it is from a void or not. Proper segmentation and correct classiﬁcation of the training data makes the training samples to become of high quality.  4.2.2. SVM model building and training In the ﬁrst place, the kernel function should be determined. We compare the classiﬁcation accuracy of SVM using different kernels without optimizing any parameter. The K-fold cross validation technique is adopted to evaluate the accuracy (Moreno-Torres et al., 2012). The comparative results are given in Table 3. Table 3 shows that the calculation results are consistent with most experiences. Without optimizing any parameter, the SVM with a RBF kernel has achieved the classiﬁcation accuracy higher than 80% in training samples. So RBF is selected as the kernel function for the SVM model in this paper. In the second place, the two parameters in the SVM model, the penalty factor C and the coefﬁcient σ 2 in the kernel, need to be determined. Here, the grid search technique is adopted to ﬁnd the optimal C and σ 2 (Wang et al., 2012), and the relevant parameters for grid search are listed in Table 4. The classiﬁcation accuracy changes with different combinations of C and σ 2 values. Fig. 10 presents the relationship. After the grid search, the optimal C = 2.0 and the σ 2 = 55.7 are found, which achieves a classiﬁcation accuracy of 98.65%. 4.2.3. Automatic recognition results and discussion Now the trained SVM model is ready to recognize GPR images and is tested by the GPR image shown in Fig. 5b. Every trace of the image is ﬁrstly segmented and feature extracted according to the method of forming training data in order to obtain test samples. Then these samples are input to the SVM model. The model gives the tag ‘1’ to the samples which are recognized as voids and ‘0’ to the samples which are recognized as non-void. To visualize the recognition results, tag ‘1’ is painted blue and tag ‘0’ is painted red. The synthetic GPR image and its automatic recognition result are shown in Fig. 11. The trained SVM model ﬁnds out all the three voids, although misjudges a small area. The recognition accuracy is summarized in Table 5. From the above result, the proposed method can accurately locate the cover depths and lateral ranges of the voids. One drawback is that,  Table 5 Recognition accuracy of the SVM model.

The synthetic GPR image with 5% noise and its recognition result: (a) simulated image with 5% noise, (b) recognition result.  it cannot tell the thicknesses of the voids accurately. This is because in feature extraction, only the reﬂections from the upper surface of the voids are extracted as features with void information, while those from the lower surface of the voids are difﬁcult to be extracted, as they are too weak or mingled with the multiples. Besides, the algorithm misjudges some of the multiple waves from the right void as another target, resulting in the appearance of two vertically separated targets, as shown in Fig. 11b. To test if the automatic recognition method is suitable for identifying real GPR images, three levels of noise (5%, 7% and 10%) are added to the synthetic image respectively to make them more close to real ones. The recognition results are given in Figs. 12 to 14. It is shown that the trained SVM model can still identify voids in the synthetic GPR image with 5% noise without bringing in many misjudgment areas; when the noise level reaches to 7%, misjudged areas become more; when it reaches to 10%, voids cannot be recognized anymore.  FDTD method and the characteristics of the synthetic GPR images are analyzed. It is noticed that multiple waves caused by steel bars are found to have an adverse impact on void locating. According to the periodical characteristic of the multiple waves, the predictive deconvolution is applied to suppress them. After processing, the multiple waves are suppressed to an acceptable extent. Then, a SVM model is developed to automatically identify voids in the synthetic GPR images. It achieves the accuracy higher than 95% in void burial depth location and 80% in void lateral range location, which shows its feasibility. Finally, three levels of noise are added to the synthetic GPR image to test the method's ﬂexibility for recognizing real GPR images. The results are still preferable when the noise level is below 5%. But when the level exceeds 5%, the performance of the SVM model degrades signiﬁcantly and cannot identify any void in GPR images. Testing the auto-recognizing algorithm for real laboratory models will be a future work.  5.
