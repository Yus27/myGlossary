Abstract—The topographic relief of a typical groundpenetrating radar (GPR) survey can easily be in the range of the target depth. In complex subsurface settings, this requires the application of topographic migration schemes to reliably image subsurface structures. Furthermore, a shallow ground water layer introduces significant vertical variations in GPR propagation velocity, which should be considered during migration to accurately image subsurface structures. In this paper, we present a modified topographic migration scheme, which is able to account for vertical variable velocities by using the root-mean-square (rms) velocity approximation. We evaluate our migration scheme by using synthetic and field data, which represent typical near-surface sedimentary structures often investigated using GPR. These examples demonstrate that a significant improvement in structural imaging quality is achieved by considering rms velocities during topographic migration. Index Terms—Ground-penetrating radar, topographic migration, variable velocities.  I.

Although many GPR profiles are reasonably well migrated using constant velocities, this assumption is insufficient for some other typical subsurface settings. For example, such a setting is the transition from unsaturated soil into the saturated zone, which can easily result in a factor ~2 decrease of wave propagation velocity [2]. Consequently, to obtain a correctly migrated image for the entire depth range, vertical velocity variations have to be taken into account during migration. In the following, we present a topographic migration scheme which utilizes the root-mean-square (rms) velocity approximation [6], [7] to account for vertical velocity changes. After testing our topographic migration scheme using synthetic data, we apply it to field data collected across a shallow aquifer system, where we know that GPR velocity varies vertically between ~0.07 m/ns and ~0.120 m/ns within the upper 3 m to 5 m of the subsurface.  During the past decades, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) gained increasing attention for structural exploration of the II. M ETHODOLOGY shallow subsurface. Examples of successful subsurface imaging are well know from engineering, archeology, and hydrology Here, we propose a modification of the topographic migration [1], [2], [3]. The applied processing procedures are very similar scheme by [5]. This migration scheme relies on the topographic to the processing of reflection seismic data. Accordingly, expansion of the Kirchoff migration approach by [8] and has the correct representation of subsurface structures is only been successfully applied to 2D and 3D GPR data for example achieved by propagating the wavefield backwards in time. by [9] and [10]. This processing step is known as migration. It accounts for The original migration scheme presented by [5] relies on a two effects commonly observed in subsurface exploration constant velocity assumption. Our modification replaces the by reflected wavefields. On the one hand, migration moves constant velocity assumption with the rms velocity approxidipping reflectors into their correct position. On the other hand, mation. This approximation depends on the interval velocity diffraction hyperbolas are summed up into their source point. in each layer and the travel time differences inside the layers In complex subsurface media, both effects have a severe impact [6], [7]. In the presence of mainly vertical velocity variations on the final subsurface image and, if not corrected for, hinder and small refraction angles, rms velocities provide a sufficient a detailed interpretation of the structures [4]. Thus, migration velocity approximation for the migration scheme [11], [8]. is an essential step for processing GPR reflection data. The topographic relief of a typical GPR survey can easily III.

To evaluate the effect of our migration scheme in such settings, we design a two-layer synthetic model (Fig. 1a) with a width of 20 m and a depth of 5 m. The first layer simulates unsaturated, dry sands with a velocity of 0.120 m/ns. The second layer can be regarded as saturated sediments represented by a velocity of 0.075 m/ns. The transmitters and receivers are located along a simulated hill-structure having a width of 8 m and a maximum height of 1 m compared to its surroundings. This setting results in a maximum topographic gradient of 21◦ . To investigate and illustrate the effect of different migration schemes, we introduce two square velocity anomalies (0.10 m wide) at a depth of 2.5 m and 3.2 m (Fig. 1a).  40 60 80 100  (a)  120 2  4  Depth (m)  1 2 3 4 5  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  Distance (m)  0  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  20  Figure 2.

Synthetic Results  The rms velocity information required for our topographic migration scheme is calculated from the initial velocity models shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a.

A migration velocity of 0.095 m/ns results in collapsing the upper diffraction hyperbola, while the lower diffraction hyperbola is overmigrated because of an inaccurate migration velocity at this point [4]. Reducing the migration velocity to 0.088 m/ns causes the lower diffraction hyperbola to collapse, but results in an undermigration of the upper diffraction hyperbola (Fig. 3c). Finally, we topographically migrate the data using the rms velocity information (Fig. 3d). By including vertical velocity information in the topographic migration scheme, it is possible to focus the horizontal reflector and to collapse both diffraction hyperbolas properly. 2) Model B: Figs. 4a and 4b present the results of the topographically migrated data for the Model B. Fig. 4a shows the migration result when assuming a velocity which corresponds to the velocity of the upper layer. The migration result indicates the original syncline, but does not correctly image minor undulations of the reflector topography (compare Figs. 2a and 4a). Moreover, in the central part artifacts caused by overmigration are visible between ~30 ns and ~60 ns. Considering vertical velocity variations by using an appropriate rms velocity model within the topographic migration scheme, we are able to reconstruct the complex topography of the reflector (compare Figs. 2a and 4b).  40 60 80 100 reflector position 120 2  4  6  8  10  16  18  Distance (m)  Figure 4.

This survey comprises constant offset data recorded along a ~85 m long profile using an offset of 1 m, 200 MHz antennas, a sampling interval of 0.3 ns, and 16 vertical stacks. We employed a kinematic surveying strategy  based on combining our GPR system with an auto-tracking total station [14]. The topographic variations along this profile are ~2.8 m. GPR data processing included zero-time correction, dewow, band-pass filtering, amplitude scaling based on division by a time and spatially smoothed amplitude envelope, and gridding the data to a regular trace spacing of 0.1 m. The GPR data after topographic correction (static shift correction using a velocity of 0.125 m/ns) are presented in Fig. 5. From observation wells and a previous geophysical survey [15], we know about the presence of a ground water level a few meters below ground surface. In our CMP measurements (not shown here), we observe it as a strong decrease in propagation velocity from ~0.125 m/ns to ~0.07 m/ns. In Fig. 5, the groundwater table is visible as the horizontal reflection at ~50 ns. As demonstrated by our synthetic examples, such a setting requires the application of a topographic migration scheme which is able to account for vertical variable velocities. The velocity information from our CMP measurements enables us to construct an appropriate rms velocity profile and employ it in our migration scheme. In Fig. 5, reflections are visible until ~400 ns. We are able to distinguish two sedimentary units in this time window. The upper unit (above ~230 ns) is dominated by horizontal, mostly parallel to subparallel reflections. The transition into the second unit is characterized by a toplap boundary. The lower unit (below ~230 ns) consists of continuous reflectors which show an apparent dip in eastern direction. The result of our migration scheme (Fig. 6) shows major improvements between ~50 ns to ~150 ns. Here, we are able to improve the continuity of the reflectors and remove disturbing energy originating from diffraction hyperbolas (e.g. diffraction hyperbola underneath point A (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Similar observations are visible between ~210 ns to ~260 ns, where the toplap becomes more pronounced in the migrated image (compare area from ~20 m to ~50 m in the west of point B). Furthermore, the continuity of deep reflectors between 300 ns to 400 ns benefits substantially from the migration process (compare reflector below point C). V. C ONCLUSION The presented migration approach extends the existing topographic migration scheme [5] to account for vertically variable velocities represented by a corresponding rms velocity model. We evaluated our approach by using synthetic data sets with topographic variations within the order of the target depth and a sharp vertical velocity contrast simulating, for example, GPR surveys at sites with a shallow groundwater table. Our results demonstrate that a topographic migration scheme, which accounts for variable velocities, is required for a correct representation of nonplanar subsurface structures underneath a layered medium. We successfully applied our migration scheme to field data, where a shallow ground water table is present. The migrated image shows higher reflector continuity and is mainly free from diffraction hyperbolas. Remaining migration artifacts might be related to minor lateral velocity variations or 3D effects  not considered by our 2D migration routine. The extension of our approach to 3D is straightforward and is a focus of future work. In conclusion, the presented approach is useful to achieve a reliable and detailed structural GPR image at sites characterized by complex terrain and significant vertical velocity variations.
