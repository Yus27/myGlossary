Detection of Debondings with Ground Penetrating Radar using a Machine Learning Method Shreedhar Savant Todkar1,# , Cédric Le Bastard1 , Amine Ihamouten1 , Vincent Baltazart2 , Xavier Dérobert2 , Cyrille Fauchard1 , David Guilbert1 and Frédéric Bosc1  Abstract—In the field of civil engineering, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is the most widely used method of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). Using supervised learning methods or signal processing methods, it is possible to analyze the sub-surface defects in pavement. In this paper, we propose to use a supervised machine learning method called Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect the presence of debondings within the pavement. Here, the ground-coupled GPR in quasi mono-static configuration along with SVM is used to detect debondings. The experiments are done on bituminous concrete pavements with various material characteristics. The classification results show the efficiency of the detection process. Index Terms—Civil Engineering, Ground Penetrating Radar, Support Vector Machines, Bituminous pavement.  I. I NTRODUCTION  R  OADWAYS are the most widely spread network means for transportation across the world [1, 2]. A wide variety of materials are used for the construction of these pavements which include bituminous concrete, hydraulic concrete etc. With the passage of time, these pavements undergo deterioration caused by both - the environment and the traffic [3]. The structural pavement diagnosis is hence necessary in order to prevent disasters. So, pavement monitoring is the key element in the management of the wide network of roadways throughout various countries [4, 5]. Various methods of pavement monitoring have been studied in [6–10]. They can be classified as Destructive and Nondestructive testing. Under destructive testing, a small section of the pavement is drilled [7] (called coring) and tested to punctually monitor its health. On the contrary, Non-Destructive Testing does not damage the pavement whatsoever. Also, NDT ensures the structural integrity [11–15]. As a result, it is the most preferred monitoring technique in use. Radar systems have been used in the evaluation of the structural integrity of roadways for the past few decades [14] [16–18]. Advantages of GPR include high data acquisition rate [19] and its sensitivity to the variations of the permittivity [20], water content [21, 22], porosity of the materials [23] etc. The use of GPR systems have been one of the major achievements in the NDT for roads and pavements. It helps to determine the thickness of a layer and with the help of supervised machine learning methods [24–27] and is also able to detect the cracks 1 Centre d’études et d’Expertise sur les Risques, l’Environnement, la Mobilité et l’Aménagement (Cerema), Les Ponts de Cé, France. 2 Institut Français des Sciences et Technologies des Transports, de l’Aménagement et des Réseaux (IFSTTAR), Bouguenais, France. # Corresponding author  within the pavement. Various radar systems have been used during the past decades. The most common among them being the pulse radars. Pulse radar systems have been in use for over two decades to monitor and analyze the conditions of the road by Non-Destructive testing [28]. Pavement monitoring and detection of debondings using GPR have been discussed in [29–31]. The defects in the pavements can be classified as two types - embedded defects and open defects. The embedded defects (such as debondings) are defects that occur within the pavement. The open defects are the surface cracks which are visible from the outside. [4, 5, 31] discuss the open crack detection while [29, 30, 32] discuss the detection of embedded cracks using GPR. Like in [32], this paper focuses on the embedded defects and precisely debondings. Here, SVM is used as an alternative method compared to the ones which have been experienced in the past, e.g., [16, 17]. The objective in this paper is to improve the capability of the radar system to detect the damage incurred within a structure which will be helpful in the management and the maintenance of the roads and pavements. Pulse GPR radar with a ground-coupled and quasi mono-static antenna configuration is implemented as in [33] and SVM to detect the presence or absence of debondings within the pavements. In this paper, the debondings are experimentally detected on various representative materials. This paper is categorized as follows - Section II introduces the used supervised classification method of SVM. The implementation of SVM to detect debondings is discussed. Section III presents the experimental setup. Describing the material type, thickness and other parameters of the several test benches used, then the data acquisition technique is discussed. Then the results are discussed. In the final section, conclusions are drawn. II. SVM TO DETECT DEBONDINGS The concept of SVM was first introduced by Vladimir Vapnik [34] in 1963. Considered as one of the most powerful supervised machine learning algorithm, it achieves a superior classification performance compared to other learning algorithms in several domains [35]. It also has high generalization capability. Due to its several advantages, SVM has been extensively used for classification of data. SVM has a wide range of applications such as communications [36, 37], pattern recognition [38, 39], data analysis in medical field [40], video and image analysis [41–43] etc. The SVM algorithm is based on the Structural RiskMinimization (SRM) principle [44]. This section discusses the  A-scan Time filter  Normalized Amplitude  1  0.5  0 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  (Non-debonding) and 1 represents a defect (Debonding). Suppose that the given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. If the data is linearly separable, a Linear SVM is used. [49, 50] When the data is not linearly separable, a Non-linear kernel is used for classification [51, 52]. Let xi ∈ RN be the set of training vectors, xi represents the ith filtered A-scan; where i = 1, 2, 3, ...N, N is the number of A-scans. Let yi ∈ {−1, +1}; where y is the classifier vector. The optimization problem is given by [53] :  Time (in ns)  Fig. 1: An example of the A-scan to indicate the features minw,b,ζ  Normalized Amplitude  sub ject to  Non-debonding Debonding (1cm) Debonding (0.5cm)  1  N 1 T w w +C ∑ ζi 2 i=1  yi (wT φ (xi ) + b) ≥ 1 − ζi , ζi ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, ...N.  where φ (..) maps xi into higher dimensional functions, C > 0 is the regularization parameter, w is the weight vector and b is the bias.

A. Pre-processing of Data The efficiency at which the data is classified depends on the features that are used by the machine learning algorithm. Feature extraction not only reduces the computational data size but it can also improve the performance of the target detection [45]. Hence it is important to choose the best features. Figure 1 shows an A-scan taken from the GPR measurements during the experiments. In pre-processing, the focus is on the zone within which the debonding occurs. Then by using a time filter, a part of the signal that contains the debondings and clutter (see Figure 1) is extracted. Then, amplitude scaling is done using Min-Max Normalization [46] within the range (0,1) [47] [48] so that, every value has equal importance. The Figure 2 compares three A-scans : non-debonding, 0.5 cm debonding and 1 cm debonding. The variations in the amplitude level of the signals are used to identify the presence or absence of defects. B. Support Vector Machines In this paper, we use SVM to detect debondings in pavement. The SVM solution can be represented as a set of binary results -1 and 1; where -1 represents a defect-free pavement  where Φ(xi , x) is the kernel function, sgn is the sign function and αi are Lagrange multipliers. In this paper, C-SVM of the library LIBSVM [53] is used. Later, only the “RBF kernel” (Radial Basis Function) is presented. Indeed, tests have been carried out with the linear kernel, RBF kernel and polynomial kernel. From these tests, the best results were obtained by the RBF kernel. Thus, several hyper-parameters are to estimate (C and γ) for C-SVM with RBF kernel.  C. Machine learning principle to detect debondings The data collected from the GPR measurements is first preprocessed by time filtering. SVM requires a certain set of data (Learning data or training data) to provide an optimal hyper-plane to categorize the remainder of the database. In this paper, about 32 rd of the data is taken as “Training data” and the rest is used as testing. In these experiments, 32 different configurations of test slabs were used and 60 A-scans were taken from each slab. From these, 26 slabs were used as training data while 6 were used as testing data. So, the training database consisted of 1560 A-scans and the testing database consisted of 360 A-scans. The measurements in the two databases are mutually exclusive. During the learning process, using cross validation, optimum parameters are determined. Then the parameters are used to “predict” the results for the test database. Figure 3 is a flowchart that shows the principle used to detect the debondings.  Fig. 5: A bituminous concrete test slab  Fig. 3: SVM implementation flowchart  Fig. 4: Layer-by-layer depiction of the experimental setup of the test bench (with debonding)  1 cm. The next two layers are either a combination of BBTM and BBSG, BBTM and GB or BBSG and BBTM [15]. Also, each slab is different from the other based on various Degrees of Freedom. There are four degrees of freedom for this experimental design : • Emulsion quantity (0 g m−2 , 200 g m−2 , 400 g m−2 and 600 g m−2 ) • Nature of the layers (BBTM above BBSG / BBSG above GB etc.) • Layer thicknesses (BBTM / 3 cm, BBSG / 6 cm and GB / 11 cm) • Compaction level (between 75 % and 96 %) Figure 5 shows one of the test slab (Layer 3 + Layer 4) with the top layer made of BBTM and the bottom layer made of BBSG with the emulsion quantity of 400 g m−2 .  III. E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS A. Experimental Design and Setup  B. Data Acquisition  For the experiments, a set of 32 different configurations of bituminous concrete slabs with variations in thickness, aggregate size, compaction levels etc. are used. Each test bench is composed of four layers as shown in Figure 4. To get a better understanding of layers 1, 3 and 4 in Figure 4, the layer nomenclature for the experimental test slabs is as follows : • BBTM (Béton Bitumineux Très Mince is the French term for UTAS : Ultra-thin Asphalt Surface): a very thin Bituminous concrete layer with an average thickness of 2.0 cm to 2.5 cm. The binder content is about 5.5 % and the aggregate size fraction is 0/10 mm. • BBSG (Béton Bitumineux Semi-Grossier is the French term for semi-coarse hot-mix asphalt): it is an HMA used for surface layers in roadways with medium to high traffic. The average thickness of this layer is 5.5 cm to 6.0 cm. The binder content is 5.2 % and the aggregate size fraction is 0/10 mm. • GB (Gravier Bitumineux is the French term for base course bituminous gravel): The average thickness ranges from 10.5 cm to 11.5 cm whereas the binder content is only 4.0 % and the aggregate size fraction is 0/14 mm. Layer-1 is a BBTM with an average thickness of about 2.5 cm to 3.5 cm. Layer-2 is an artificially introduced debonding layer with three different thicknesses- 0 cm, 0.5 cm and  Figure 6 shows the equipment used to collect the data for processing. The data acquisition device used is the GSSI SIR3000 (developed by the Geophysical Survey System, Inc.). The SIR-3000 was used in association with high-frequency ground-coupled quasi mono-static antennae. The antennae are in near-field condition (very close to the slab surface) and measurements were performed longitudinally. Six B-scans were made at a distance of 5 cm apart on each test slab. The central frequency is set at fc = 2.6 GHz. For each B-scan, about 120 A-scans were recorded along the length of the test bench. In the experiments, 60 A-scans were taken from the central region of the slabs to avoid the reflections from the edges. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the experimental setup for data acquisition and their individual B-scans for 0 cm, 0.5 cm and 1 cm debonding respectively. C. Results and Discussion In this section, the results of the experiments carried out on the artificial defects introduced in each test bench are presented. The parameters Precision (Pr ), Sensitivity (Se ) and Dice Score (DICE) [54] are used to express the results. They are given by : Precision (Pr ) =  TP T P + FP  (2)  0 0.5  Time (in ns)  1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  Number of A-scans  Fig. 6: Experimental Setup: GSSI SIR-3000 with ground-coupled Tx-Rx antennae  (a) B-scan for Sample 1 (No Debonding)  0 0.5  Time (in ns)  1  (b) Sample test bench 2 depicting horizontal stratification with 0.5 cm debonding  1.5 2  Fig. 8: Case 2.

Following are the four categories of the confusion matrix : • Debonding present and detected as a Debonding (TP) • Debonding present but detected as a Non-Debonding (FN) • Non-Debonding present and detected as a NonDebonding (TN) • Non-Debonding present but detected as a Debonding (FP) The Figure 10 is an example of the representation of results using the Confusion Matrix.  (b) Sample test bench 3 depicting horizontal stratification with 1 cm debonding  Fig. 9: Case 3. Debonding of 1 cm thickness  The hyper parameters (C and γ) were set to 100 and 0.05 respectively. Table I shows the results obtained using the SVM classifier for both the learning and the testing databases. From Table I, it can be seen that the results for the Learning Database are perfect. All Pr , Se and DICE are 1.0 (or 100%). Table I also shows the values of Pr , Se and DICE for the testing database. Here, the testing database is built using the data from the test benches that are not included in the training  1 Estimated value  Classification Indicator (0 = No debonding; 1 = Debonding)  FP  True value  TP  FN TN 0  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  Number of Scans  Fig. 10: An illustrative representation of the Confusion matrix TABLE I: Results for Bituminous pavements using SVM Parameters  Learning Database  Testing Database  Dice Score (DICE)  1.0  0.9605  Precision (Pr )  1.0  0.9906  Sensitivity (Se )  1.0  0.9336  database. It can be seen that the value of Se and Pr are about 0.93 and 0.99 respectively. These results indicates that some defects were classified as non-debondings (FN) and a very negligible amount of non-debondings were falsely detected are defects (FP). IV. C ONCLUSION The aim of this paper was to detect the presence of debondings within bituminous pavements with the use of SVM. The first part introduced to the concept of SVM and the method in which it is used to detect debondings in the pavements. Using the GSSI SIR-3000, measurements were made on a set of 32 samples of bituminous pavements. Then, data processing was done using the Kernel based SVM. The collected information was then analyzed to detect the debondings. From the tests and the results, it is shown that the SVM, by classification, is capable to detect debondings from ground-coupled radar. In perspective, this method will be used to assess the performance in situ and also over a larger amount of test slabs. Furthermore, this method will be compared with other supervised learning methods. ACKNOWLEDGMENT A special thanks to Marc Brenugat towards his valuable contributions for conducting the experiments.
