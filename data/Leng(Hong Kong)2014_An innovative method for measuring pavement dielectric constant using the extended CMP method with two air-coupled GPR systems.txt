Introduction The ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic (EM) wave-based method, which has been successfully used as a nondestructive tool for pavement evaluations, such as the measurement of pavement layer thickness [1–6], detection of pavement distress [7–9], determination of depth and alignment of steel bars in concrete pavements [10,11], and estimation of asphalt pavement density and air void [12–16]. Among the various applications of GPR for pavement evaluation, the measurement of layer thickness is by far the most common and successful. GPR thickness data is collected for the purposes of: (a) overlay design and prediction of pavement service life, (b) support of other testing techniques, such as falling weight deﬂectometer (FWD) testing, and (c) quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) when new pavement systems are constructed or old pavements are overlaid. Although GPR ability to measure pavement layer thickness has been extensively documented, investigators have reported various GPR performance results based on the site surveyed and the technique of GPR data analysis used. Lahouar et al., for instance, reported an average error of 6.8% in estimating the thickness of asphalt pavement layers ranging from 280 to 350 mm (11 to 14 in.) thick for an old pavement system (Interstate 81), while a 3.8% error was reported for an asphalt layer  n  Corresponding author.

In another study, Maser reported thickness accuracies of 7 7.5% for asphalt layers with thicknesses ranging from 51 to 500 mm (2 to 20 in.) and 712% for granular base layers with thicknesses ranging from 150 to 330 mm (6 to 13 in.) [2]. Loizos and Plati reported an average error of between 5% and 10%, depending on the dielectric constant estimation technique utilized [3]. Al-Qadi et al. conducted GPR surveys on a test section of Route 288 in Richmond, Virginia, to evaluate the performance of GPR when used as a QA-QC tool for a newly built pavement system [4]. GPR data were collected over the granular base layer and the three different asphalt layers after each layer was laid down. Measurements were taken approximately ﬁve hrs after the asphalt mixture was laid down. A comparison of GPR thicknesses with the thicknesses measured directly from ﬁeld cores revealed an average error of 2.9%. It was concluded that the GPR tools were highly accurate in this case because of the homogeneity of layers, which were newly constructed at the time of the survey. However, it is worth noting that in most of the aforementioned studies, the surface reﬂection method with one air-coupled GPR system was used to calculate the material dielectric constant for pavement thickness measurement [5]. This method is easy to implement and provides reasonably accurate results. However, the method assumes that the pavement material is lossless (i.e., zero conductivity) and has uniform dielectric property through depth. This assumption applies for newly built ﬂexible pavements, but it cannot provide reliable information for the whole layer and the estimation error may increase when the asphalt mixture ages or  Z. Leng, I.L. Al-Qadi / NDT&E International 66 (2014) 90–98  when the asphalt layer is made of multiple lifts. To overcome the limitations of the reﬂection amplitude method, this study has been conducted to develop an innovative method, the extended common mid-point (XCMP) method, based on time delays of two aircoupled GPR systems sharing a common mid-point. The XCMP method estimates the average dielectric constant of a material layer based on the average travel speed of GPR wave within the layer. Results are therefore more representative for the whole layer compared with the results obtained from the surface reﬂection method, which does not consider any dielectric constant changes through the layer depth. The following two tasks have been speciﬁcally conducted in this study:   Development of equations and implementation algorithm for the XCMP method.   Validation of XCMP method based on GPR data collected from a custom-designed test site.  2. Background on GPR and dielectric constant estimation The majority of GPR systems used for highway applications are impulse systems, which emit short EM pulses to penetrate pavement from a moving antenna and record reﬂected echoes created at pavement surface and internal inhomogeneities. The two-way travel time to the target and amplitudes of the reﬂected pulses can then be measured in time domain. GPR technology offers the advantage of high speed data collection and a continuous proﬁle of dielectric constants. A GPR system is typically composed of an antenna, a data acquisition system, a distance measuring instrument (DMI), a survey vehicle or cart, and an optional GPS (Fig. 1). The antenna is the core component of the GPR system. A monostatic GPR system used the same antenna as transmitter and receiver, a bistatic system uses one antenna for transmission and another for reception, and a multistatic system uses a single antenna or multiple antennae as transmitters and multiple antennae as receivers. GPR systems are classiﬁed into air-coupled systems and ground-coupled systems, depending on how the antennae are mounted. Air-coupled “horn” antenna systems are typically mounted 150 to 500 mm (6 to 20 in.) above pavement surface, as shown in Fig. 1. It is preferable to use an air-coupled antennae mounted on a holding bracket attached to the front or rear bumper of a survey vehicle in pavement applications in order to  91  collect GPR data at highway speeds. The elevated antenna reduces antenna-ground and antenna-target interactions and thereby results in less antenna clutter and a clear surface reﬂection (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, a ground-coupled antenna is in full contact with pavement surface (Fig. 1). The EM waves emitted by a ground-coupled system can penetrate deeper than those emitted by an air-coupled system with same antenna frequency because pavement surface reﬂects less energy. However, GPR survey must be performed at a much lower speed, usually less than 8 km/h (5 mph). The incidence of surface coupling, which is caused by the overlap of the emitted and reﬂected signals at the surface (Fig. 2 (b)), is yet another disadvantage represented by ground-coupled systems. Surface coupling makes it difﬁcult to determine the exact time when the GPR signal hits the pavement surface without signal processing. Therefore, ground-coupled systems are not recommended for the accurate measuring of pavement thickness [17]. The application of GPR is based on the dielectric characteristics of transmission materials. The dielectric constant provides basic information for obtaining layer thickness and material condition in a GPR survey. The most common method for estimating the dielectric constant of in-place pavement materials is based on reﬂection amplitude at pavement surface. Fig. 3 depicts a typical EM reﬂection from a layered system made of homogeneous and lossless materials. According to the surface-reﬂection method, the dielectric constant of the ﬁrst layer, εr,1, can be estimated nondestructively from GPR-collected signal, based on the following equation [18]  εr;1 ¼    1 þ ðA0 =Ap Þ 1  ðA0 =Ap Þ  2 ð1Þ  where εr,1 is the dielectric constant of the ﬁrst layer, A0 is the amplitude of surface reﬂection, and AP is the amplitude of the incident GPR wave, which can be obtained by collecting data over a copper plate placed on pavement surface. Amplitudes can be obtained directly from GPR data, as shown in Fig. 3. Once the dielectric constant of surface layer is known, the travel speed of EM wave within this layer can be calculated using Eq. (2). c v ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ  ð2Þ  εr;1  where v is the wave propagation speed, and c is the speed of light in free space (c ¼ 3  108 m=s).

Thickness of the surface layer can then be calculated by using the following equation: ct 1 d1 ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ: 2 εr;1  ð3Þ  where t1 is the two-way travel time of GPR signal within the surface layer, which can be obtained from GPR data.  3. Algorithm of the extended common mid-point method Surface reﬂection, based on Eqs. (1)–(3), is the most commonly used method for estimating pavement material dielectric constant. This method is easy to implement and provides reasonably accurate results. However, it is based on the assumption that pavement material is lossless (i.e., pavement with zero conductivity) and has uniform dielectric property through depth. This assumption applies for newly built, ﬂexible pavements, but it cannot provide reliable information for the whole layer because the estimation error may increase when the asphalt mixture ages or when the asphalt layer is made of multiple lifts. To improve the accuracy of the reﬂection amplitude method, another type of methods based on the time delays of two GPR systems are applied. Time-delay methods calculate the average dielectric constant of a material layer based on the average travel speed of GPR wave  within the layer. Thus, the results are more representative for the whole layer compared with the results of Eq. (1), which is based on surface reﬂection only without consideration to dielectric constant changes through the layer depth. The most commonly used time-delay method is the common mid-point (CMP) technique, which is often employed in seismic tests to estimate the velocity of seismic waves [19]. This technique is also useful for estimating the velocity of EM waves in a speciﬁc material, and ﬁnding its dielectric constant, according to Eq. (2). Lahouar et al. developed the modiﬁed CMP method by using an air-coupled GPR system with a ground-coupled antenna [1]. The method was used to predict the asphalt layer thickness of a section of I-81, in Virginia, built between 1963 and 1965. The survey was conducted using a combination of a 900 MHz ground-coupled antenna and a 1 GHz air-coupled antenna system, as shown in Fig. 4. It was reported that thickness prediction errors ranged from 1% to 15% with a mean error of 6.8%. The errors were attributed mainly to the inaccurate localization of surface reﬂection from the ground-coupled antenna, which usually overlaps with the coupling pulse (Fig. 2). In addition, the use of ground-coupled antenna limits the speed of the survey, which represents yet another limitation for this technique. This study develops an extended CMP (XCMP) method by using two air-coupled GPR systems for the purpose of improving the modiﬁed CMP method. The exclusion of the ground-coupled  Z. Leng, I.L. Al-Qadi / NDT&E International 66 (2014) 90–98  antenna from the XCMP method results in an accurate location of signal surface reﬂection and allows for a high survey speed. Derivation of the equations of this new method is discussed below. As illustrated in Fig. 5, both air-coupled bistatic systems (T1/R1 and T2/R2) are set at height d0 above the ground. In this ﬁgure, T represents the transmitter and R represents the receiver. The separation distance between the transmitter and receiver of the inner system (T1/R1) is x01, and that of the outer system (T2/R2) is x02. The distance between the incidence point and reﬂection point of T1/R1 is x1, and that of T2/R2 is x2. x1 and x2 are unknown because the dielectric constant of Layer 1, εr,1, the incidence angles, θi1 and θi2, and the transmission angles, θt1 and θt2, are unknown. The following relations exist according to Snell’s law [20] pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð4Þ sin θi1 εr;0 ¼ sin θi1 ¼ sin θt1 εr;1 ; sin θi2  pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ  pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ  εr;0 ¼ sin θi2 ¼ sin θt2 εr;1 :  Combining Eqs.

It should be noted that t1 and t2 are not the same as Δt1 and Δt2, shown in Fig. 6, which are the respective differences in the two-way travel times between surface reﬂections and bottom reﬂections of the two GPR systems. Instead, the following relations exist:  Fig. 4. CMP conﬁguration using a ground-coupled monostatic system and an air-coupled bistatic system [1].

Steel plate and coring locations.  4. Validation of the XCMP method To validate the ability of the XCMP method for estimating the dielectric constants and thicknesses of pavement layers, the method was implemented to collect GPR data from a custom-designed test site containing pavement sections with different design thicknesses. As shown in Fig. 7, the test site had four sections with respective design thicknesses of 5.08 cm (2 in.), 10.16 cm (4 in.), 15.24 cm (6 in.), and 20.32 cm (8 in.). Each section was 3.35 m (11 ft) long and 3.35 m (11 ft) wide. Transition sections were placed between neighboring sections to facilitate pavement construction. In order to receive clear GPR signal reﬂection at the bottom of each AC lift, thin steel plates were buried in each test section. Steel plates are perfect reﬂectors of GPR signals, which mean that the GPR wave energy will be completely reﬂected by the steel plate. The locations of the asphalt layer bottom could be detected easily and accurately by identifying strong steel plate reﬂections in GPR signals. Note that the steel plates are not required for GPR measurements in practice; but were only used to validate the results in research. Fig. 8 shows the steel plate layout in the test site: one steel plate was placed in each section before the construction of each new lift. After construction, there were one  steel plate in Section 1, two in Section 2, three in Section 3, and four in Section 4. To achieve the XCMP antenna conﬁguration, two 2 GHz aircoupled bistatic GPR systems manufactured by the Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI), as shown in Fig. 9(a), were used in this study. Each antenna case contains two antennae inside: a transmitter (T) and a receiver (R), as shown in Fig. 9(b). To maximize the difference between Δt1 and Δt2 and achieve a better resolution, the antenna pairing conﬁguration, shown in Fig. 9(a), was selected. T1 and R2 represent one antenna pair and T2 and R2 represent the other. After selection of the GPR system setup (Fig. 9(a)), two GPR surveys were conducted with the XCMP setup: one along the centers of the steel plates on the south side, and the other along the centers of the steel plates on the north side (Fig. 8). Fig. 10 shows raw GPR images from the two surveys. Two sets of GPR data were collected simultaneously in each survey with the XCMP setup: one from antenna pair T1/R2, and the other from antenna pair T2/R2. The plateau shapes in these GPR images indicate the locations of steel plates buried at different depths underneath the pavement surface. To match the data of the two antenna pairs, i.e., make them share the common mid-point, data from T2/R2 were  96  Z. Leng, I.L.

Al-Qadi / NDT&E International 66 (2014) 90–98  shifted 45.7 cm (18.0 in.) forward because the separation distance between centers of the two antenna cases was 91.4 cm (36.0 in.). After collection of GPR data, the XCMP algorithm presented in the previous section was applied to predict the dielectric constant and layer thickness of each section. To assess the accuracy of the XCMP method, the layer thickness predicted by the XCMP method was compared with the real pavement thickness, which was obtained by extracting cores from each section. In total, ten cores were extracted at the centers of the steel plates (Fig. 8), four of which have one single lift, three cores have two lifts, two cores have three lifts, and one core has four lifts, as shown in Fig. 11. Each lift is approximately 5 cm (2 in.) thick. Table 1 presents the GPR-measured Δt1 and Δt2 at each core location. The dielectric constants and thicknesses of the ﬁeld cores were calculated from Δt1 and Δt2 by solving Eqs. (16) and (17) numerically. The lab-measured core thicknesses were used as a reference to calculate thickness prediction errors of the XCMP method. For comparison purpose, the dielectric constants and thicknesses of the ﬁeld cores were also predicted by using the traditional surface-reﬂection method, as shown in Table 2. Fig. 12 shows a comparison of thickness prediction error between the XCMP method and the surface-reﬂection method. In this ﬁgure, the prediction errors of both methods were plotted against the core thickness. Obviously, the XCMP outperformed the surface-reﬂection method for thick multi-lift pavement cores (thickness 410 cm or 4 in.), except for the 12.1-cm (4.75-in.) core. However, the XCMP method resulted in larger errors than the surface-reﬂection method for thin single-lift pavement cores (thickness o10 cm or 4 in.).  4-lift  3-lift  2-lift  97  The varying performance of the XCMP method in thin and thick pavements was mainly caused by the sampling rate limitation of GPR systems. For thin pavements, the difference between Δt1 and Δt2 is so small (around 0.02 ns) that current GPR systems (resolution around 0.003 ns) may not be able to detect such small difference accurately. However, for thick pavements, the difference between Δt1 and Δt2 is relatively large (0.05 ns to 0.1 ns). Thus, the effect of the GPR sampling rate is diminished. The errors of the XCMP method in thin pavements may also be caused by the possible signal overlap between signal surface and bottom reﬂections. However, the XCMP method performed much better for pavement layers thicker than 10 cm (4 in.).  5. Summary The XCMP method was developed by using two air-coupled bistatic GPR systems for pavement surface dielectric constant estimation. The average (or bulk) dielectric constant and thickness of the asphalt pavement surface can be determined based on the data collected from two air-coupled GPR systems, which share the common mid-point. This technique works better for pavements containing multi-lifts or pavements with non-uniform properties through depth, compared with the classic method based on surface reﬂection. In addition, this method dispenses with the ground-coupled antenna, therefore, the time delays of the two GPR systems can be estimated at a higher level of accuracy, and the GPR survey can be conducted at a higher speed. For the XCMP method equipment setup, two 2 GHz air-coupled GPR systems were used in this study.

Prediction error comparison between the XCMP method and the surfacereﬂection method.  of the XCMP method were evaluated using the data collected from test pavement sections with different thicknesses. It was found that the XCMP method produced smaller thickness errors than the surface-reﬂection method for thick multi-lift pavement sections, while for thin single-lift pavement sections with a thickness ranging from 4.3 to 6.3 cm (1.7 to 2.5 in.), the performance of the XCMP method was not as good as the surface-reﬂection method. This performance variation is caused by the sampling rate limitation of the GPR systems, as well as the possible overlap of GPR signal reﬂections at the surface and bottom of asphalt layers. The GPR systems used in this study had a maximum workable sampling rate of 1024 samples/scan. When GPR systems with higher sampling rates are used, the accuracy of this method is expected to increase. In addition, both GPR systems used in this study are bistatic, and they ﬁx and seal the antennae within the antenna case. The conﬁguration of using a monostatic air-coupled system and a bi-static system with adjustable separation distance between transmitter and receiver may also enhance this technique by increasing the difference between Δt1 and Δt2. Although this study applied the XCMP method to predict the dielectric constant of the pavement surface, the same algorithm is generally applicable for measuring the dielectric constants of many other structures, such as the railroad ballast, road bases, and bridge decks.
