Introduction Layer thickness is important in the asphalt pavement system, and most asphalt pavement design processes consider it to be the most important parameter [1,2]. For newly constructed asphalt pavement, layer thickness is used for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA); for existing pavement, it is used for condition assessment and in predicting the remaining service life. Predicting the layer thicknesses is, therefore, necessary whether during construction or for existing pavement. However, it still remains an issue to estimate asphalt layer thickness effectively and nondestructively. Traditionally, coring has been the prevalent method for agencies seeking to obtain asphalt layer thickness [3]. However, taking cores results in pavement defects; for this reason, the number of coring locations is usually limited. In addition, coring provides limited layer thickness information of the asphalt pavement. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) represents an alternative, nondestructive method. GPR is a radar system used to investigate the subsurface. GPR has been used in transportation infrastructure surveying: in ﬂexible pavement (asphalt pavement), GPR technique can estimate the dielectric property (electric permittivity) of pavement n  Corresponding author.

American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard [10] provides a procedure of applying GPR for subsurface investigation. One of the most successful applications of GPR on ﬂexible pavement is in estimating layer thicknesses—a job for which the two-way travel time method was traditionally employed. The permittivity of the asphalt material was usually determined by the surface reﬂection method [11]. The major limitation of this approach is that the surface reﬂection cannot be obtained with enough accuracy. Calibrating the dielectric constant by taking cores may improve the dielectric constant accuracy; however, this is, again, destructive, which is not desirable. Leng and Al-Qadi [12] developed the extended common midpoint (XCMP) method, which can be used on 2 GHz air-coupled pulsed horn antennas to estimate asphalt pavement thickness with high accuracy without the need for dielectric constant calibration via coring. This was an extension of the common-midpoint method [13,14]. One of the disadvantages of pulsed horn antenna is that the GPR survey is limited to a line scan. In applications where large areas need to be surveyed—e.g., an airport runway/ taxi way—the GPR survey with single-horn antenna can be extremely time consuming. The 3-D GPR was recently developed in Norway. It contains an antenna array, which has a very close sampling interval in the cross-line direction. This 3-D GPR enables data collection at much faster speeds, making it possible to efﬁciently survey large areas.  30  S. Zhao, I.L. Al-Qadi / NDT&E International 78 (2016) 29–36  3-D GPR has been used for evaluating civil engineering structures over the past ten years. In 2001, 3-D GPR was successfully used in mapping pipes, cables, and old tramlines under streets in Trondheim, Norway [15]. During the survey, the 3-D radar was operated in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 1.6 GHz. The results of the study show that by applying different bandpass ﬁlters based on antenna sensitivity, utility lines under the pavement can be successfully mapped by 3-D GPR at different depths. Another study compares the results of air-coupled 3-D GPR with 400-MHz ground-coupled, pulsed antenna to detect underground archeological structures in the Roman town of Augusta Raurica in Switzerland [16]. The study concludes that the air-coupled 3-D GPR can penetrate less deeply, as compared to the ground-coupled, pulsed GPR, due to the high reﬂection at the ground–air interface of the air-coupled antenna. The main objective of this research was to integrate the XCMP method with stepped-frequency 3-D GPR. As a result, large areas can be surveyed using 3-D GPR at faster speeds, and a twodimensional thickness proﬁle can be generated with high accuracy without the need of dielectric constant calibration via coring. To achieve this objective, the research efforts focused on characterizing 3-D GPR properties, developing signal-processing techniques as a preprocess of the XCMP method, and developing numerical methods to solve the XCMP equations. To validate the outcome of this study, four XCMP conﬁgurations were tested on a full-scale test site, and ground truth data were obtained. This approach allows the accuracy for each of the XCMP conﬁgurations to be assessed and corresponding recommendations to be proposed for the practical use of XCMP methods with 3-D GPR.  2. Extended CMP method Multi-offset methods were originally used in seismic migration to measure seismic wave velocity [17]. The common source method and common midpoint (CMP) method are the two common multi-offset techniques [18] The CMP method has been recently used to calculate the electromagnetic (EM) wave velocity within asphalt concrete pavement layers using ground-coupled antennas [12]. The extended CMP (XCMP) method also allows calculation of the EM wave velocity within the asphalt pavement layer, while using air-coupled antennas. Fig. 1 shows the conﬁguration of the XCMP method. Two aircoupled bistatic antenna systems are used. “Tx” and “Rx” represent the transmitting and receiving antenna, respectively. The antenna height is d; the pavement thickness is h; the distances between antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 are x01 and x02 , respectively; and they share the same midpoint, P1 and P2. The dielectric constants of the free space (air) and the asphalt concrete are ε0 ¼ 1 and ε1 , respectively. Fig. 1(a) shows the reﬂection paths from the surface of the asphalt concrete layer, where the two-way travel times of antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 aret 11 and t 21 , respectively. Fig. 1(b) shows the reﬂection path from the bottom of the layer, where the two-way travel times of antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 in the air are t 12 and t 22 , respectively; the two-way travel times of antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 in the pavement are t 1 and t 2 , respectively; the incident angles at the surface of the layer of antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 are θi1 and θi2 , respectively; and the transmission angles at the surface of the layer of antenna pairs Tx1/Rx1 and Tx1/Rx2 are θt1 and θt2 , respectively.

Based on the geometry shown in Fig. 1 and Snell's law, the following four equations can be obtained: x  x 2 t 21 ðx22  x21 Þ2 01 1 þ1 ¼ 2 2 ; 2d t 1 ðx2  x21 Þ2 x21 c2 ðt 22  t 21 Þ2  ð1Þ  x  x 2 t 22 ðx22  x21 Þ2 02 2 þ1 ¼ 2 ; 2 2d t 2 ðx2  x21 Þ2 x22 c2 ðt 22  t 21 Þ2  ð2Þ  Δt 1 ¼ t 1 þ Δt 2 ¼ t 2 þ  qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 2 d þ ðx01  x1 Þ2 =4 c qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 2 d þ ðx02  x2 Þ2 =4 c      2  qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 d þ x201 =4 c  2  qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 d þ x202 =4 c  ;  ð3Þ  :  ð4Þ  where c ¼3n108 m/s is the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space. Detailed derivation of the XCMP method can be found in Leng and Al-Qadi [11]. With Δt 1 and Δt 2 directly obtained from the collected signals (Fig. 2), the four unknowns x1 , x2 , t 1 , and t 2 can be solved numerically using the optimization method described in the following sections.

Signal processing 3.1. 3-D GPR signal characteristics The resolution of GPR signal is important in the XCMP method, as it determines the ability to distinguish adjacent pulses. A signal  S.

Example of 3-D GPR signal and Whittaker–Shannon interpolation.  with a wider frequency band usually has a greater resolution than one with a narrow band signal. The 3-D GPR uses the “bow-tie” antenna as the array element. The bow-tie antenna is a broadband antenna, which has a pattern, gain, and impedance nearly constant over a wide frequency range because it has an active region that relocates on the antenna as the frequency changes. In addition to a better time domain resolution, the bow-tie antenna also has ﬁner lateral resolutions because bandwidth is the most important factor for the resolution [19]. Due to the constant radiation pattern over very wide frequency bands, 3-D GPR can radiate signals at stepped frequencies. Stepped-frequency signals have successive pulses with linearly increasing frequency in discrete steps. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the frequency increases with time by the frequency step, while the dwell time is the duration over which each frequency is emitted. The time domain sketch of the signal is shown in Fig. 3(b). It should be noted that the stepped-frequency signal is collected in the frequency domain. Speciﬁcally, the amplitude and phase of the frequency response is recorded at each frequency step by sending and receiving the corresponding harmonic waves. The time domain signal can then be retrieved by calculating the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response. An example of the 3-D GPR signal reﬂected back from a twolayered asphalt pavement system is shown in Fig. 2, where the ﬁrst peak is the direct coupling pulse, the second peak is the surface reﬂection, and the third peak is the reﬂection from the bottom of the surface layer. 3.2. Whittaker–Shannon interpolation According to the previous sections, the XCMP problem is formed as a set of four nonlinear Eqs. (1)–(4). Numerical solutions, such as least square solutions, are needed to solve these equations. However, such equations are not necessarily stable, meaning that a small perturbation in the inputs (x01 , x02 , d,Δt 1 , and Δt 2 ) could have a huge inﬂuence on the outputs (x1 , x2 , t 1 , and t 2 ). The geometric layout of the 3-D GPR was provided by the 3-D Radar Company, and therefore the values of x01 , x02 , and d have been well calibrated to yield sufﬁcient accuracy. After sensitivity analysis, it was found that the output results are most sensitive to the change of Δt 1 and Δt 2 . Because the 3-D GPR collects signals in the frequency domain, the time domain signal is “synthetized” by inverse Fourier transform of the frequency domain signal, and the time domain signal  Fig. 3.

For the DX1821 3-D GPR, the time domain sampling interval is 0.12207 ns; and the corresponding upper limit of the frequency band is 8.19 GHz. However, if we assume that the frequency content of the 3-D GPR signal above the upper limit of the frequency band is all zero, the time domain sampling interval of the signal can be decreased by zero  32  S.

The corresponding time domain process is the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation, or the sinc interpolation:   1 X t  ndt xðtÞ ¼ ð6Þ x½nsinc dt n ¼ 1 where discrete time signal x½n is continuous time signal xðtÞ sampled at ndt, n is an integer, sincðxÞ ¼ sinxðxÞ is the sinc function, and dt is the time domain sampling interval. If the sampling interval dt meets the Nyquist criteria—i.e., the sampling frequency 1/dt is higher than twice the maximum frequency content of the analog signal—then Eq. (6) can perfectly restore the original analog signal xðtÞ; otherwise Eq. (6) gives an approximation of the original analog signal xðtÞ. In practice, we can interpolate x½n to obtain the time domain signal with the desired time sampling interval:   1 X mT  ndt xnew ½m ¼ xðmTÞ ¼ ð7Þ x½nsinc dt n ¼ 1 where xnew ½m is the interpolated discrete signal, m is an integer, and T is the desired time domain sampling interval. From a signal-processing point of view, Eq. (7) can be considered as, ﬁrst, up-sampling the discrete signal x[n] and then, second, ﬁltering the up-sampled signal xnew ½m with an ideal low-pass ﬁlter. The process can also be performed in the frequency: to perform an m  point sinc interpolation on x[n], ﬁrst pad zeros behind XðωÞ, the DFT of x[n], such that the length of the padded frequency series is m times longer than the original XðωÞ, and then do the inverse DFT on the zero-padded frequency series. In this study, it was found that a hundred-point Whittaker–Shannon interpolation could provide a sufﬁcient time domain sampling interval.  3.3. Numerical solving technique After Δt 1 and Δt 2 are obtained from the interpolated signals, based on Eqs (1)–(4), the four unknowns x1 , x2 , t 1 , and t 2 can be solved. Because Eqs. (1) and (2) cannot be solved analytically, the least square solutions of x1 and x2 are calculated. The entire solving process is summarized below. 1) Select the GPR signals reﬂected from each steel plate (the maximum reﬂection coefﬁcient location). 2) Perform a hundred-point Whittaker–Shannon interpolation on each of the GPR signals and then obtain Δt 1 and Δt 2 . 3) From Eqs. (3) and (4), t 1 and t 2 can be expressed in terms of x1 , x2 . Substituting t 1 and t 2 into Eqs. (1) and (2) yields two equations with two unknowns x1 and x2 .  S. Zhao, I.L.

Experiment plan with 3-D GPR to validate XCMP method With the XCMP method described in the previous section, Leng and Al-Qadi [8] successfully validated that the pulsed antenna can provide better accuracy in determining asphalt pavement layer thickness than the surface reﬂection method. In that study, two air-coupled horn antennas manufactured by Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. [21], were used. A test site was constructed as shown in Fig. 4. There are steel plates, which can be regarded as perfect reﬂectors, embedded at the bottom of each asphalt lift to increase the reﬂection coefﬁcient. The layout of the steel plates is shown in Fig. 4. This study used a DX1821 antenna array manufactured by 3DRadar Company. The DX1821 system has eleven bow-tie transmitting antennas and eleven receiving antennas (Fig. 5). It has a total width of 1.8 m with an effective scan width of 1.575 m. Each  Fig. 5. DX 1821 antenna array layout, standard survey and XCMP 1–5 test conﬁguration. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  33  of the bow-tie antennas has an ultrawide frequency band from 200 MHz to 3 GHz and can radiate EM signal in a steppedfrequency manner, as explained in the signal-processing section. The element spacing is 0.15 m. A total of 21 channels could be conﬁgured arbitrarily between one transmitting antenna and one receiving antenna [21]. The test site has four sections, each of which is a 3.35 m by 3.35 m (11 ft by 11 ft) square. The design thicknesses of Sections 1–4 are 50.8 mm, 101.6 mm, 152.4 mm, and 203.2 mm, respectively. There are three transition zones between each section to facilitate the construction process. Each transition zone has a length of 3.96 m. To survey the whole lane, a wood trailer was built to carry the 3-D GPR—as shown in Fig. 6—together with the antenna array and control unit. Based on calibration, the phase center of each bow-tie antenna was found to be 0.369 m above the ground. To apply the XCMP method, several different antenna scan patterns are designed to have multiple XCMP offsets. The authors devised ﬁve testing plans to ﬁnd the best conﬁguration based on the results. Plan 1 is XCMP 1–3, meaning that the cross-line offset between Tx1/Rx1 is 1 interval, and the cross-line offset between Tx2/Rx2 is 3 intervals. “In-line” and “cross-line” refer to the directions parallel to the survey direction and the length of the antenna array, respectively; and the cross-line intervals and in-line intervals were 0.075 m and 0.44 m, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. Similarly, Plan 2 is XCMP 1–5, Plan 3 is XCMP 1–7, Plan 4 is XCMP 3–5, and Plan 5 is the standard scan pattern, meaning that each of the Tx/Rx pairs has an in-line offset of 1 spacing. Table 1 shows all the testing plans, where the distances are the actual distances. In Fig. 5, the standard scan pattern has 21 measuring points (denoted by the yellow circle at the center point of each antenna pair). By changing the antenna Tx/Rx pair, the XCMP 1–5 conﬁguration can be set up as shown in the blue lines in Fig. 5. Because the DX 1821 antenna array is about half the width of the survey lane, two GPR surveys were conducted to cover the whole lane: one along the center of the south side of the survey lane and the other along the center of the north side of the survey lane. After all 10 GPR surveys (2 surveys for each test plan) were completed, the collected GPR data were converted to time domain signals and corresponding signal-processing techniques were applied (see signal-processing section). The signal directly reﬂected from the center of each steel plate was used to calculate the dielectric constant and layer thickness. The signal reﬂected from the center of each steel plate can be found approximately by identifying the maximum reﬂection amplitude. Cores were drilled at the center of each steel plate, and their thicknesses were measured in the laboratory to provide the asbuilt pavement thicknesses of each section. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm could then be evaluated (see next section).  Control Unit Survey Lane  Wood Trailer  Table 1 XCMP antenna setting plans. Plan 1  Antenna Array  Fig. 6.

GPR data horizontal slices at different depths: (a) south lane, (b) north lane.  5. Test results and discussion 5.1. 3-D GPR standard scan pattern Before doing the XCMP test, a survey with the standard scan pattern (plan 5) was ﬁrst conducted to show the layout of the two asphalt pavement lanes. The trigger distance was set to 7.50 cm, the depth range was set to 125 ns, and the dwell time was set to  1 ns. The detailed setting is shown in Table 2 (channels 19–21 can be found in Fig. 5). For each of the two lanes, the collected signal is a 245 by 409 by 21 3-D matrix, where 245 is the number of time steps, representing the through depth direction; 409 is the number of scans along the lane, representing the in-line direction; and 21 is the number of channels, representing the cross-line direction. By selecting different time steps, the horizontal slices of the  S. Zhao, I.L. Al-Qadi / NDT&E International 78 (2016) 29–36  pavement at different depths can be obtained. For example, Fig. 7 shows the four slices at the depths of the embedded steel plates for both south and north lanes. The rectangular spots in Fig. 7 represent areas with very high reﬂection coefﬁcients, corresponding to the places where steel plates are embedded. Together with the steel plate conﬁguration shown in Fig. 4, the steel plates can be clearly identiﬁed. This shows the ability of 3-D GPR to map pavement sections accurately and rapidly. It should be noted that in some of the GPR horizontal slice signals, there are some rectangular spots resulting from the echoing effect, which is caused by the EM wave bouncing back and forth between asphalt layers. The echoing effect can be better observed in the vertical slices of the GPR data. Fig. 8 shows two vertical slices passing through the center of each steel plate in both south and north lanes, i.e., the B-scan images. The “white line” at the top of both ﬁgures is the direct coupling pulse due to the antenna interaction, and the second “white line” is the reﬂection at the surface of the asphalt pavement. The short “white plateau” represents the location where steel plates are embedded. The echoing effect can be clearly seen beneath each of the steel plates. For steel plate ♯1, the reﬂection overlaps with the surface reﬂection due to the layer thinness.  Fig. 8. GPR data vertical slices passing the center of each steel plate: (a) south lane, (b) north lane.  35  5.2. XCMP test results Four XCMP testing plans were performed to obtain the depth of the steel plates; i.e., XCMP 1–3, XCMP 1–5, XCMP 1–7, and XCMP 3–5, as shown in Table 1. The detailed testing plan conﬁgurations are shown in Table 2. All of the other parameters, including the trigger distance, the depth range, and the dwell time, were the same as for the standard testing plan, as explained in the previous section. After all GPR data were collected, the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation was performed. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of the GPR signal before and after interpolation. It can be seen that the original peak location is shifted after the signal is interpolated, resulting in a more accurate determination of Δt i . The actual core thicknesses measured in the lab are considered to be the ground truth and are shown in the last row of Table 3. Table 3 also lists the prediction errors of the results from all four XCMP conﬁgurations. It is found that for steel plate ♯1, ♯4, ♯6, and ♯8, where the layer thickness is one lift (50 mm design thickness), all four XCMP conﬁgurations give no solutions due to the overlapping of the signals from the surface reﬂection and the reﬂection from bottom of the surface layer. This observation implies that the bandwidth, which determines the time domain resolution, of the 3-D GPR is not enough to resolve layers thinner than 64 mm. The XCMP 1–3 conﬁguration does not have a solution for steel plate ♯2. This is because the difference between Δt 1 and Δt 2 is too small: 0.02 ns in this case. Sufﬁcient difference between Δt 1 and Δt 2 is required to solve the XCMP equations. The difference between Δt 1 and Δt 2 may be increased either by increasing pavement layer thickness or by increasing the difference between the offsets of the antenna pairs. For steel plates ♯2, ♯3, ♯5, ♯7, ♯9, and ♯10, the average relative thickness prediction errors are 5.05%, 3.37%, 5.22%, 4.35%, 15.72%, and 2.70%, respectively. The cause of the high prediction error at steel plate ♯9 is the echoing of the surface reﬂection (similar to the echoing shown in Fig. 8), which shifts the second peak of the reﬂection at the bottom of the surface layer. According to Table 3, it is shown that XCMP1–5 and XCMP1–7 have average relative prediction errors of 2.85% and 3.45%, respectively, which are much better than the accuracy of XCMP1–3 and XCMP3–5 (8.58% and 8.56%, respectively). The average absolute error for both XCMP1–5 and XCMP1–7 conﬁgurations is 5 mm, which meets the construction tolerance. It should be noted that XCMP can be used to obtain the dielectric constant of asphalt concrete. Speciﬁcally, if the dielectric constant is constant throughout the pavement, average dielectric constant values may be obtained from various locations. The averaging process will eliminate random errors, such as those from the echoing effect. Using the averaged dielectric constant and traditional two-way travel time method, an accurate thickness proﬁle may be obtained. In this case, the nondestructive XCMP method serves the same purpose as the dielectric constant calibration by taking cores. The XCMP also provides greater area coverage.

Conclusions The XCMP method is an alternative to the traditional two-way travel time method to estimate asphalt pavement thickness, and it can provide more accurate dielectric constant values without calibration. This study attempts to integrate the XCMP method with a stepped-frequency antenna array—3-D GPR—by developing signal-processing techniques and numerical analysis methods. A full-scale asphalt concrete test lane was utilized to evaluate the performance of the XCMP method with 3-D GPR. The thickness of the asphalt pavement ranged from one lift to four lifts (each lift is around 50 mm thick). Steel plates were embedded under 10 locations with different layer thicknesses to increase the reﬂection amplitude. Five 3-D GPR conﬁgurations were designed: standard scan pattern, XCMP1–3, XCMP1–5, XCMP1–7, and XCMP3–5. A Whittaker–Shannon interpolation algorithm was developed to increase the time domain sampling rate, which is important for solving the XCMP equations. A numerical solving technique based on the least squares principle was introduced to solve the XCMP equations. The introduced algorithm was used on the GPR signal reﬂected from 10 steel plates. Cores were taken at each steel plate's location, and their lab-measured thicknesses were chosen as the ground truth. A comparison of the XCMP-measured thickness with the ground truth shows that 3-D GPR can be used together with the XCMP method to estimate asphalt layer thickness with good data acquisition speed and a large coverage area. Based on the results, the ﬁndings of this study are summarized as following:   Accurate determination of Δt 1 and Δt 2 are critical in the XCMP      method. Whittaker–Shannon interpolation can be applied to the 3-D GPR signals to increase the time domain sampling rate. The four XCMP equations can be solved numerically utilizing the least square error approach. Constraints need to be set based on the physical representation of the variables to ensure valid outcome. As the difference between Δt 1 and Δt 2 in the XCMP is larger, the higher the accuracy of the thickness estimation. For layers thicker than 64mm, the average thickness estimation error for both XCMP1–5 and XCMP1–7 is 5 mm, which meets the construction tolerance. Therefore, in practice, 3-D GPR XCMP1–5 and XCMP1–7 are suitable for asphalt pavement thickness estimation.  7. Recommedations This study shows the feasibility of 3-D GPR to estimate asphalt pavement thickness using the XCMP method. As a continuation of the study, the recommendations for future study are as follows:   For asphalt pavement thinner than 64 mm, the current 3-D GPR system does not have enough resolution. Therefore     super-resolution techniques are needed to estimate thin layer thickness. The performance of the 3-D GPR in estimating the asphalt pavement thickness using XCMP method need to be further evaluated without the use of steel plates. It is necessary to introduce signal-processing techniques to eliminate the effect of surface reﬂection echoes.  References [1] Huang YH. Pavement analysis and design.
