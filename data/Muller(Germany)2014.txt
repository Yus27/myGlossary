However, there are several issues that have limited the wider use of GPR for pavement investigations, particularly when combined with detlection measurements. One issue is the mismatch in data collection speed between fast GPR and slow methods such as FWD [II]. Recent developments in rapid continuous deflection measurement devices, specifically the traffic speed detlectometer (TSD) [12]-[13], show potential to overcome this speed limitation while also producing deflection results similar to those from FWD [14]. Furthermore, preliminary investigations indicate TSD results complement and correlate well with GPR measurements enabling far more rapid pavement investigations [15]. Another issue affecting the GPR itself is the need for a fast and accurate method to calibrate layer depth predictions for changes in the bulk relative permittivity (Er) of pavement layers. While several calibration methods exist they are slow and destructive, or alternatively lack accuracy in lossy and more variable pavement conditions.  Abstract- An update on the development of a self-correcting method of calibrating pavement layer depths is presented.

Accurate pavement layer depth information is important for various pavement management applications [1]-[2]. However, in many instances layer depths are unknown or construction records are unreliable, requiring field investigations to confirm the true conditions. Various authors have described the benefits of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to determine layer depths of existing roads for inventory or segmentation purposes, project or network level assessments or for use in structural assessments combined with deflection measurement devices such as the falling weight detlectometer (FWD) [3]­ [10].  CALIBRATION ApPROACHES  There are several approaches for GPR pavement layer depth calibration. A common approach involves adjusting assumed bulk permittivity values and the corresponding depth of layer interface predictions within a GPR radargram until they match the findings of physical sampling from cores or trenches. While simple and providing 'ground-truth' comparisons, this approach is also slow, costly, disruptive and damages the pavement. Consequently it often becomes impractical for large-scale investigations. A popular alternative is the surface reflection coefficient method. This approach involves using an air-coupled antenna  978-1-4799-6789-6114/$31.00 ©2014 Crown  887  15th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar - GPR 2014  equipment provides many potential advantages for pavement investigations.  to compare the magnitude of the surface reflection to the reflection from a reference calibration plate placed on the road surface. From this comparison an estimate of near-surface permittivity is determined, and a similar approach can be applied to subsequent layers [1], [4], [6], [19]-[21]. While fast, simple and non-destructive the underlying assumptions of layer homogeneity and the omission [6], [20] or assumption of constant signal attenuation [2] can lead to errors, particularly for more variable and lossy pavement materials. Such conditions can be expected in older, more degraded pavements or where moisture or compaction gradients are present. Another approach is to use Full Waveform Inversion techniques to determine layer depths and pavement dielectric properties [22] - [24]. While this approach offers flexibility to model a range of material attributes and can use off-the-shelf equipment, the modelling process is also somewhat complicated; calculation intensive and procedures are not yet sufficiently streamlined for field use.  III.  CALIBRATION CONCEPT  The current work uses simulations of the expected response of the forthcoming 3D NM-GPR system update described previously [15], [32]-[33]. Fig. 1 shows the updated NM-GPR equipment, prior to completion.  An alternative approach involves the use of multi-offset methods. Here geophysical methods are used to determine wave velocities within individual layers based on the change in arrival time of the groundwave and reflection arrivals at varying transmitter-receiver spacings [25]. Common midpoint (CMP) and wide angle reflection and refraction (WARR) are two commonly used multi-offset antenna configurations. However, to date the use of multi-offset methods has been somewhat limited for road investigations, though with some notable examples in the literature [2], [26] -[29]. Perhaps the most sophisticated use to date involved use of a 3D GPR system with air-launched antennas to rapidly collect CMP data [30]. Semblance and the Dix equation were then used to determine wave velocities for layer depth calibrations. However, the use of air-launched antennas for such applications leads to significant refraction and range resolution issues compared to ground-coupled configurations [31].  Fig. 1. Updated 3D NM-GPR system.  The antenna configuration of the new system consists of a row of 8 transmitters (Tx) and a row of 20 receivers (Rx). These are housed within four adjacent ground-coupled pods, each of which contains 2 transmitters and 5 receivers. By pairing different transmitters and receivers a series of virtual antennas is achieved across the lane width arranged into eight partially-overlapping WARR groups (see Fig. 2). When operating at 100 km/h all 8 WARR groups complete their measurements every 60 mm along the road (adjustable), providing multi-offset measurements across the lane width.  There are several potential advantages of using multi-offset methods for pavement investigations. For one they enable layer depth calibrations based solely on the GPR data itself, largely avoiding the need for physical sampling and risk of misaligning GPR data with physical samples. As such they could potentially be advantageous for large-scale investigations where physical sampling is cost prohibitive and impractical. If using ground-coupled arrays, multi-offset methods also provide two approaches to determining electromagnetic (EM) wave velocity - based on layer reflections and groundwave arrivals. These in tum could potentially be compared to investigate near surface material gradients. Furthermore, unlike surface­ reflection-based methods, multi-offset reflections have passed through entire pavement layer depths on their way back to the GPR receiver. Thus intra-layer variations, for example moisture or compaction gradients, will proportionally influence the measured response. Consequently multi-offset methods should provide more representative estimates of bulk layer properties. However, disadvantages of these methods include increased data quantity, complexity and also many GPR practitioners are unfamiliar with this data type. Furthermore the methods outlined here also require specialised equipment for data collection. Nonetheless multi-offset data collected at highway speeds using the next generation of 3D GPR  Fig.2. Illustration of the 3D NM-GPR antenna configuration and combinations used to achieve the eight WARR groups.  To enable calibration of the GPR layer depths two self­ correcting analysis methods are being investigated: Interface matching and ray-path modelling. A.  Inteface matching (1M)  As the positions of virtual antenna pairs produced by adjacent WARR groups partially overlap, and as road layers are often relatively consistent across their lane width, it follows that after normal moveout (NMO) correction the depth of any continuous interface must be consistent across adjacent WARR groups. This then provides a basis for determining EM wave velocities. That is, adjust the assumed layer velocities until the calculated depth of NMO-corrected layer interfaces within the NM-GPR data are consistent between adjacent WARR groups.  888  15th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar - GPR 2014  B.  Prior to applying the 1M and RM methods, the general approach outlined in [17] was used. This included adding noise to the simulations to better model real GPR data. An automated tracking algorithm was then used to track groundwave arrivals across the WARR groups, and from this its velocity was determined. An initial NMO correction of the data was then undertaken using the groundwave velocity to produce an approximate pavement cross-section (Fig. �). Next the ?pe�at?r selects a point on each layer interface of mterest, whIch IS m turn tracked across the cross-section (Fig. 4) and full WARR datasets (Fig. 5). Next, conventional geophysical methods were used to determine interval velocities for each layer and WARR group based on the time of the tracked layer interfaces. These then form the starting point for further refinement of layer depth and permittivity estimates using the 1M and RM methods.  Ray-path modelling (RM)  This approach involves determining the two-way travel time for each pavement layer and antenna pair within each WARR group. Initial estimates of interface depth, angle and layer permittivity for each layer are adjusted within a 3D ray­ path model until the predicted reflection times for all antenna pairs of the modelled layer and WARR group best match that observed within the field WARR measurements. The use of a 3D ray-path is intended to provide more accurate ray-path and travel time predictions and greater flexibility to deal with more complex pavement configurations, for example those with sloping layers. IV.  ApPROACH AND RESULTS  To model the expected NM-GPR response for typical pavement configurations, GPRMax software [34], which uses the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach, was used in combination with MATLAB software [35]. This approach was used to quickly generate GPRMax input files for each of the eight WARR groups and to instigate their simulations. This enabled various combinations of layer depths and permittivity to be quickly and easily trialled. For the initial phase of modelling, 2D simulations with homogeneous horizontal layers were used. To account for the longitudinal offset between the transmitter and receiver arrays, receivers were placed within the 20 models at their radial offsets (Fig. 3). Later, 3D GPRMax models were used to more accurately model sloping layer interfaces. However, due to memory limitations the 3D models needed to be kept relatively coarse compared to the 2D models (5 mm v. 2 mm Yee cells). This resulted to notable steps within the sloping interfaces, which in turn had an influence on the GPR response and analysis results.  A.  Interface Matching  The 1M method commences by using a simplified 20 ray­ path model to determine the depth of the uppermo�t tracked pavement interface. To achieve this, the depth of thIS layer at each tracked point, antenna pair and WARR group is calculated based on its reflection time. Assumptions of horizontal homogeneous layers and the bulk relative permittivity or corresponding wave velocity are assumed. Once completed, a line of best fit is determined through the point from each WARR group closest to the transmitter. As the NMO:correct�d depths in these locations are least affected by the chOIce �ftnal velocity, this line provides a relatively stable reference. Elth�r a straight line or curve can be used, depending on the reqUIred flexibility. Next, the error between the line of best fit and the predicted layer depths are determined for each WARR group. . The assumed permittivity for each WARR group IS then adjusted after which the layer depths and line of best fit are recalculated. Permittivity adjustments are continually adjusted within each WARR group until they are minimised. The permittivity for this completed layer is then fixed for each WARR group and the process is repeated for subsequent layers. For these lower layers, inter-layer refraction is also . . considered when calculating layer depths, usmg the determmed and trial permittivity values to determine the refracted ray-pat�.

This approach determines the two-way travel time using a ray-path model. The procedure commences using the estimated interface depths and layer permittivity using conventional geophysical methods. The 3D ray-paths and corresponding two-way travel times are then determined for each antenna pair within the first WARR group for the first pavement interface. The predicted times are then compared with the time of tracked layers within the GPR data. The assumed interface depth, transverse interface angle and layer pennittivity for the WARR group are then adjusted and the ray­ path and travel time are recalculated. The process continues for the current layer until the best match between predicted and tracked layer times is achieved. The process continues for each subsequent layer within the current WARR group, or alternatively is repeated for the current layer across all WARR groups. Like the 1M approach, inter-layer refractions of the ray­ path are detennined using trial layer properties. However, as the method considers non-horizontal interfaces in its calculations, it should provide a more accurate ray-path and reflection-time predictions. 3D  O.S  o,s  U  o.a  1  1  1.2 1.4  1.2 1.4  1.6 U  1.5  2  U  2  2.2 H  2.2 2.4 H  2.4  2.S  Rx position (m) Rx position (m) Rx position (m) Rx position 1m) Rx position (m) Rx position (m) Rx position (m) Rx position (m  Fig 5.

As the RM approach treats all WARR groups separately and does not match adjacent interfaces it is more flexible, thus potentially more able to consider lateral variations within the GPR response such as sloping layers. However, this flexibility can also be a disadvantage, resulting in greater instability in the predictions across the road width (Fig. 8).  04  08  08  X  O,90"------�0�5----�----,�.5----�-----.J  O  0.05  10" Travel time  (s)  DiH.

The 1M approach has produced relatively accurate analysis in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, particularly for the uppermost layers where layer depths are shallow relative to the antenna separations. When applied to the sloping interfaces, as shown in Fig. 7, the 1M method results in a small discrepancy in the determined interface angles. However, considering this approach assumes a 2D model and horizontal layers this result is relatively good. For layers at greater depths the results of the  1.5 Width(m)  Fig. 7. GPRMax 3D model (solid colours) compared to 1M predictions of bulk permittivity and interface layer depths (lines)  890  15th International Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar - GPR 2014  1M method diverge from those of the model (Fig. 7). However, it should be noted that the conventional geophysical results also substantially deviated from the model for these deeper layers and produced more variable depth predictions. Regarding the RM approach, the layer depth and permittivity predictions matched the model relatively closely in the uppermost layer of the example shown in Fig. 8. A small error in permittivity for the uppermost layer is noted at one location (i.e. the Cr 4.3 value), however this coincides with a step in the 3D model and is likely to be due to this feature. As the depth of layer interfaces is not constrained by the results of adjacent WARR groups, layer predictions using the RM approach are more variable, particularly for the deeper layers. Owing to their approach, both the 1M and RM methods are sensitive to calculation errors in the preceding layers. Consequently the accuracy of predictions is expected to decrease with depth of features and number of layers. Furthermore the flattening of hyperbolic reflectors at greater depths, particularly when using narrow receiver spreads, also limits the sensitivity of this approach. Thus a potential method to improve the results would be to program an occasional WARR or CMP fold using a single transmitter and the full set of receivers, say once every 50 profiles, to maximise fold spread. As the updated NM-GPR is fully programmable, such an approach should be possible if the standard configuration proves inadequate during field use.  errors in the preceding layers and measurement insensitivity for lower layers. Despite these issues, the combination of multi-offset data collected using 3D noise modulated GPR (NM-GPR) and the proposed analysis techniques is expected to bring many practical benefits compared to conventional methods. This is particularly the case for larger scale uses where physical sampling becomes impractical and for more variable pavement conditions where existing non-destructive calibration methods falter. Development of these techniques is continuing and field trials to assess the accuracy and reliability of the proposed methods will soon commence.  =  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  The author expresses his sincere thanks to Dr Bryan Reeves and Dr-Ing.

REFERENCES  Both the 1M and RM approaches provide certain advantages and limitations in practice. In theory RM should produce superior results due to more accurate 3D ray-path modelling. However, in practice its increased flexibility also increases instability in the data analysis. As the lateral gradient of most pavement layer interfaces is typically mild, reductions in analysis stability may well outweigh any theoretical advantages in flexibility or accuracy. In any case the final analysis method will most likely incorporate aspects of both 1M and RM methods to ensure the best balance of stability and accuracy for layer permittivity and interface depth calibrations. V.  CONCLUSIONS  An update regarding the development of a self-correcting approach for calibrating the depth of road pavement layers using 3D multi-offset ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been presented. The approach commences by using a combination of conventional geophysical methods and layer tracking algorithms to estimate layer depths and bulk permittivity values. Afterwards, one of two self-correcting analysis �ethods, interface matching (1M) or ray-path modelling (RM), IS used to fine-tune the results. Examples of applying these methods to 2D and 3D finite difference time domain (FDTD) models for typical pavement configurations have been presented. Overall, both methods provided good estimates of layer permittivity and depth for the uppermost pavement layer, though the accuracy of these methods decreases for subsequent layers and increasing interface depth. Advantages of the 1M approach include increased stability, consistent layer depth predictions and reasonable results on mildly sloping pavement layers. By contrast the RM method enables greater flexibility, though at the cost of greater prediction instability. The accuracy of both methods is influenced by the aggregation of  891  [1]  K. R.
