A novel drilling technique requiring no water while drilling, combined with borehole-televiewer measurement was used to test and verify GPR interpretation results, and thus proving the accuracy and correctness of GPR profile interpretations.  GPR profiles could reflect clearly the karst cavities below the depth greater than 5 meters, but the detail characteristics at the depth from 0 to 5 meters are concealed by the flat events resulting from the substructure strata in basement and from ground surface installations.

Data Acquistion  Data were collected using a Sensors & Software EKKO PRO GPR system with pulser votage 1000 V transmitter unit and 100 MHz antennae in reflection mode. Five railparallel sections were collected along the railway at each artificially trenched section (Fig.  2).  The transmitter and  receiver antennas are perpendicular to the rails along the rail-central survey lines (line  "LM" and  "RM")  and  parallel to the rails along other three survey lines (line "LL" , "M" and  at the artificially trenched section between  "RR").

The GPR profiles in Fig.3 show that a group of karst cavities exist between mileage 825-965 at depth from 5 to 20 meters, and there are small caves or solution crevasses existing at depth from 2.5 to 5.0 meters. Fig.4 shows a profile collected along survey line "LL" at the  artificially  trenched  section  between  mileage  K I256+758-880. This profile with background removal shows a group of karst cavities existing between mileage 760-810 and a cluster of karst cavities developed along a slant solution crevasse existing between mileage 818-880 beneath the basement. The corresponding geological model (Fig.5 b) of the cluster of karst cavities developed along a slant solution crevasse can be deduced from the GPR section (Fig.5 a).

RESULTS FROM DRILLING WORK AND BOREHOLE  meters. To drill to the caves beneath railway basement  TELEVIEWER MEASUREMENT  from the railway outward sides, slant borehole is designed (Fig. 6). Totally 10 slant boreholes respectively located at different artificially trenched sections were designed and drilled. All the boreholes met karst cavities at the depth from 2.5 m to 5.6 m. Following the drilling, borehole­ televiewer measurement was done for each borehole. A borehole-televiewer  picture  taken  in  the  borehole  at  mileage K1256+889 is shown in Fig. 7, and it shows that the borehole met a karst cavity at about 2.7 m depth. Drilling  work  and  borehole-televiewer  measurements  proved that 100 MHz GPR profiles at artificially trenched sections are very effective in detecting and locating karst tubes and cavities existing beneath the railway basement. -.-. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. . -. -. ---. . �  "0".  down line  up line  :�: ..
