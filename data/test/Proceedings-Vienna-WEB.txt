PREFACE


TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND GENERAL MEETING



COST ACTION TU1208

“CIVIL ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR”



The Second General Meeting of the COST Action TU1208 “Civil

Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar” was held in

Vienna, Austria, from 30 April to 2 May, 2014. The meeting was

organised jointly with the 2014 European Geosciences Union

General Assembly (EGU GA, www.egu2014.eu), the venue was the

Austria Center Vienna.

This special event closed the first year of the Action's activities and

overall it included: the GI3.1 Session “Civil Engineering Applications

of Ground Penetrating Radar” of the 2014 EGU GA, the Management

Committee (MC) Meeting, and the Meetings of the four Working

Groups (WGs) composing the general pattern of the scientific

programme of the Action. The agenda of the event was very rich,

with about 100 presentations. Several new and interesting results

were presented and discussed, which were obtained by the Action’s

Members during the first year of the Action’s lifetime. The main focus

was on innovative GPR technologies and methodologies, advanced

inspection strategies and practices, accurate electromagnetic

methods for the modelling of GPR scenarios, inversion and imaging

techniques, and data-processing algorithms. Further presentations

dealt with the applications of GPR outside from the civil engineering

field, as well as with the integration of GPR with other Non-

Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques.

The joint organisation of the Second General Meeting with the 2014

EGU GA was complicated, but our efforts were rewarded. The EGU

GA brought together 12.437 scientists from 106 countries, of which

3

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





27% were students, studying all the Earth disciplines, planetary and

space sciences. Being open to such a wide scientific community, the

Second General Meeting gave huge visibility to COST and to the

Action TU1208, created new synergies and attracted new Members,

whilst providing a significant added value to the discussion of the

Action’s ongoing projects and results.

We were delighted by the participation to our meeting of Dr Diarmad

Campbell, Chair of the COST Action TU1206 “SUB-URBAN - A

European Network to Improve Understanding and Use of the Ground

Beneath our Cities.” Points of common interest between TU1206 and

TU1208 were identified and ideas for future cooperation were

fruitfully discussed. In particular, it was decided to organise together

a workshop on 3D Gelogical Modelling, to be held in Edinburgh, on

November 19-21, 2014. This event will aim to exchange progress,

problems and solutions to understand and communicate the 3D

composition and properties of the subsurface, in order to aid science-

based decision making.

The Proceedings of the Second General Meeting consist of five parts.

The first part collects contributions of general interest, including

reports on the COST Action TU1208, the COST Action TU1206, and

the COST initiatives for Early-Stage Researchers. This part of the

Proceedings also comprises three papers resuming noteworthy

training activities carried out by TU1208 Members: in Estonia, GPR

possibilities were shown to elementary-school children and citizens;

in the United Kingdom and France, practical training courses were

offered to GPR end-users.

The second part of the Proceedings focuses on the development of

innovative GPR systems, which is the main objective of WG1. The

recent NeTTUN (Leading the Way in New Technology for the

Tunnelling Industry) and ORFEUS (Optimised Radar to Find Every

4

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





Utility in the Street) FP7 projects are presented, where the use of

GPR was experimented in tunnelling works and in the installation of

pipes through horisontal directional drilling; both the projects

addressed the installation of GPR on the cutting head. Novel GPR

systems for the high-resolution inspection of walls and structures

are being developed by Action Members and the ongoing activities

are presented here. The improvement of GPR energetic properties

and the electromagnetic-field exposure of GPR users are being

studied. An in-depth comparison of results obtained by pulsed and

stepped-frequency radar systems is being performed; results are

being confronted in the time, frequency and wavelet domains.

Research activities are carried out within the Action, in order to

develop tools for accurate electromagnetic modelling of GPR

antennas in realistic environments. Finally, the first part of this

volume includes a contribution concerned with the importance of

accurate positioning in GPR surveys.

The third part of this volume collects contributions on the non-

invasive surveying, by using GPR, of pavements, bridges, tunnels,

railways and buildings; further contributions deal with the detection

of underground utilities and voids, as well as with the determination

by using GPR of the volumetric water content in structures,

substructures, foundations and soil. These are the main topics faced

by WG2 Members. For all the Projects included in WG2 of the COST

Action TU1208, the Project Leaders prepared reports, resuming the

progress of the scientific activities. Moreover, a number of new case

studies carried out by Action Members during the first year of the

Action, as a contribution to the various WG2 Projects, were presented

during the Second General Meeting and are resumed here.

The subsequent part of the Proceedings includes papers on the

development of advanced electromagnetic-modelling, imaging,

inversion and data-processing techniques for GPR (WG3 topics). The

5



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





part is opened with an introduction to inverse scattering and

processing of GPR data, followed by a paper about the finite-

difference time-domain modelling of the GPR signal based on data

obtained from other NDT methods as an approach to achieve a more

exhaustive interpretation of field data, and by a contribution about

the full-waveform inversion of GPR data for civil-engineering

applications. Next, for all the Projects included in WG3 of the COST

Action TU1208, the Project Leaders prepared reports, resuming the

progress of the scientific activities. Further papers present more in

detail how Members from different Countries contributed to the WG3

Projects during the first year of the Action.

The last part of these Proceedings includes works focusing on the

applications of GPR outside from the civil-engineering area, as well

as on the integration of different technologies for non-destructive

investigations in civil and environmental engineering, archaeology,

coastal-region and industrial-site characterisation. This part of the

volume also comprises a report resuming the objectives and main

results of the COST Action SPLASHCOS - Submerged Prehistoric

Archaeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf; such Action

ended in 2013 and was focused on the preservation, managing and

dissemination of the archives of archaeological and palaeoclimatic

information locked up on the drowned prehistoric landscapes of the

European continental shelf.

We deeply thank COST for funding the COST Action TU1208, the

Second General Meeting, and the publication of this volume. We are

grateful to the COST Office for its constant and strong support to the

COST Action TU1208 during the first year of the Action's lifetime and

“SHOWING GPR POSSIBILITIES TO ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL CHILDREN

AND CITIZENS IN ESTONIA”

Abstract

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiling is not very commonly used non-

destructive (NDT) geophysical technology in Estonia. It is mostly used by

the university researchers in the fields of geology, archaeology, ecology,

etc. There are at least two GPR systems in Estonia, and both of them are

owned by research groups at the universities. However, both groups have

recently been involved in several projects ordered by private enterprises or

public authorities. Therefore, an increasing interest in the use of GPR in

private and public sectors has recently been arisen. Such phenomenon is

most probably the result of an active educational and promotional work

carried out by the researchers from the Institute of Ecology at Tallinn

University. A number of lectures in secondary schools, practical workshops

in the city centre during the Researchers Night, lectures in summer schools

and short lectures on TV have all increased public awareness on the

possibilities of GPR.

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper introduces educational and promotional activities carried out

by the researchers from the Institute of Ecology, Tallinn University.

A senior member of the coastal research group started to use GPR

already over 20 years ago. The older GPR devices were rather heavy (had

to be carried by car), limiting the use of them. A lightweight GPR system,

SIR-3000 manufactured by GSSI, was bought in 2011. Small size, light

weight and long-lasting batteries allowed us to use it practically

everywhere. The workload of the new GPR system in our coastal research

group was not that high, and it was reasonable to use the machinery for

other purposes as well. We discovered several geology-related works

carried out by public or private companies that were often done using

destructive methods. It was obvious that most of the geological

investigations (digging, drilling, etc.) could have been done using GPR as

37



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





a non-destructive method. We witnessed several cases of unnecessary

spending. Therefore, we hoped to increase the efficiency of the Estonian

economy by educating various age and interest groups.

The following Sections present some descriptions and principles of our

educational work among different age and interest groups in Estonia.

These activities also helped us to obtain more experience in various

geological conditions and to promote our services.



2. GPR LESSONS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS

The first steps were relatively easy. Tallinn University is one of the

leaders in the field of teacher education and training in Estonia. Many

young teachers of geography, biology and natural sciences in schools

have recently graduated from our university. We offered them an

opportunity to take GPR lessons for the pupils of their schools. The

interest in the lessons was enormous. We had to select a few schools

from different regions of Estonia and plan the routes of the lectures,

combining them with our fieldworks after or before the lessons (most of

the lectures were delivered in the vicinity of our study areas). The

lectures were free of charge and we just asked the schools to organize

accommodation for us if needed (for the more remote places). We were

finally able to visit 10 schools in different regions of Estonia. We mostly

expected the pupils from grades 6 to 9. However, even some high

schoolers attended the lessons. The groups usually consisted of 10 and

20 pupils.

Our lesson was simple. The first 15 minutes was a lecture where we

described the main principles of the GPR system and demonstrated a

few examples of GPR pictures (pipes, cables, caves, buried

treasures/artificial objects, etc.). The short theoretical lecture helped the

pupils to understand the GPR images better. The following 30 minutes

were used for practical work. We walked around the school territory and

searched for buried artificial objects using GPR. The locations of heating

pipes, power cables and many other objects were marked on the ground

using wooden sticks on the grass or chalk on the asphalt. Finally, the

pupils could draw the basic schemes of the utilities located on the

territories of their schools. Moreover, in one school we found the ruins

38





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





of the old school house (nearly 100 years old). The most interesting

finding was a cave described in an old legend. We were the first ones

who found it and may confirm that the old legend is actually a true story

(Figure 1a, b).

It came out during our lessons that the younger the pupils were the

more enthusiastically they took part in the GPR activities. Therefore, we

decided to give one lesson also for the pupils of grades 1 and 2. We

decided to skip the lecture part and carry out the entire lesson on the

beach. We buried a few “treasures” in the sand to make the study more

attractive. Moreover, several simple skills were needed to reach the final

“treasure (initial finding was just the first clue to the real treasure),”

including the use of compass, reading the distance from the measuring

tape, etc (Figure 2a, b, c, d). Finally, we may conclude that the lesson for

such young pupils was a huge success. They were really enthusiastic

and proud to find the “treasure (candies, some lemonade and a book for

the school library),” and to hand over the book to the school library. The

lesson needed a little more preparatory work but the final outcome was

worth it. We also discovered (from the feedback) that the parents of the

pupils were very well informed (by their children after the lesson) on

what GPR is and how it could be used in different tasks.

some additional tools (lower left) and finally, the treasure was found

3. INVESTIGATIONS DURING THE RESEARCHERS NIGHT

We were discovered by several interest groups as a result of our lessons

in schools, and we were invited to present our equipment in the frames

of the Estonian Researchers Night held in the city centre of Tallinn.

Several researchers were demonstrating their studies, new equipment

and the most recent research findings. Hundreds of people came by and

got their first impressions on what GPR was and how it could be used.

40





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





Luckily, the event took place on the Freedom Square of Tallinn. This

square was established on top of the ruins of the old medieval city wall.

Our working group was involved in the mapping procedure of the ruins.

That gave us the opportunity to demonstrate how these old walls looked

like on the GPR screen (Figure 3a, b). The audience was rather diverse –

from kids to retired citizens.





FIG. 3 − Researchers Night was organized in the city centre of Tallinn.

GPR was demonstrated and tested among other activities (left); C) the

ruins of the buried medieval city walls were demonstrated (right).



4. JOINT FIELDWORKS WITH ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND TV CREW

The previous educational work has brought us in contact with a lot of

different interest groups and several job offers. However, we are a

research institution and our first aim is to contribute to scientific

activities. Therefore, we contacted the archaeologists from our own

university. They had preliminary information about a buried Viking ship

near Salme village on Saaremaa Island. The site was investigated using

an older version of GPR and the Viking ship was found (Figure 4 a, b, c,

d). It appeared that a pile of stones placed on top of the buried ship gave

the strongest signal and helped us to locate this object. The whole

investigation process was filmed by the archaeology students (Figure 4a).

41

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





The final movie was meant for educational purpose for the (archaeology)

students, which was another educational outcome of our activities.

special movie was designed for educational purposes (top left), search is

in progress (top right), ship was found (lower left) and archaeologists

expose the ship remains (lower right).



5. 1-MINUTE LECTURES ON NATIONAL TV CHANNEL

Our final and maybe the most notable educational and also a little bit

promotional product is one minute lecture of GPR. Tallinn University is

involved in the project called “one minute lectures.” These are short,

easy to understand and high-quality lectures introducing scientific

42



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





problems or new scientific methods/equipment. The lecture is on air on

the biggest national TV channel and the lecture with longer introduction

remains visible on the webpage of our national TV channel - Estonian

TV. Finally, it helps us to reach every Estonian’s home. Our lecture will

be (currently in Estonian only) available with English subtitles as well

(http://teadus.err.ee/v/uhe_minuti_loeng/46de5675-c067-4552-b36d-

4912a821887a).



6. CONCLUSIONS

We were facing a situation where only very few people in Estonia knew

what GPR was and how it could be used in different fields of activity. It

was just a few years ago. Fortunately, we were able to spread the

knowledge to a significant number of people without the need of

additional GPR-related projects or funding. We hope that our

promotional work has raised awareness of the Estonian companies

about the possibilities of using GPR in more efficient business activity.

Moreover, GPR profiling is an environment-friendly non-destructive

method of investigation.

“A TWO-DAY GPR TRAINING COURSE

IN THE UNIVERSITY OF GREENWICH, UNITED KINGDOM”



Amir Alani (UK), Kevin Banks (UK)

amir.alani@uwl.ac.uk

Abstract

To provide specialist and focused training in supporting GPR users (with

different capabilities and backgrounds), in partnership with industry (Blue

Hat Training), the University of Greenwich has developed a tailor-made

GPR training programme in the form of a two day course consisting of

presentation, discussion, coaching and practical outdoor tuition, using the

university’s own GPR equipment. The focus of this training is to underpin

and enhance the understanding of attendees of the applications of GPR in

the identification of utilities and associated fields.



1. INTRODUCTION

Since the release of the Mala Easy Locator in 2002, GPR (Ground

Penetrating Radar) has been introduced to the mass market as an

affordable and easy to use device. This market has continued to grow

significantly year on year as other manufacturers have released their

own variations of the entry level and easy to use GPR system.

The Easy Locator is a single channel GPR which allows the user to detect

and identify features on-site. In 2007 the entry level radar took another

step forward when IDS launched the Detector Duo, the world’s first dual

channel, easy use GPR, which expanded the capability of on-site

detection equipment to a new level.

Now, most manufacturers have released or are in the development of a

dual frequency, on site detection GPR system.

The ease of use of the entry level GPR has resulted in a dramatic decline

in the average level of education of the operator of the equipment. In the

past the user would have had to be a geotechnical or geophysical

engineer, having completed a university degree, but now the user could

be any person with a basic education.

Over recent years, the most significant growth application for GPR has

been for the purpose of utility detection. This has been driven by the

availability of affordable and easy to use equipment, and the fact that

44



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





the shape of a utility when it is depicted on the GPR display is relatively

easy for most users to learn to recognise. GPR solves a problem which

currently cannot be solved in any other way: the detection of nonmetallic

utilities such as gas pipes.

Despite this, a GPR operator requires training and experience to get the

best out of their equipment and many operators lack this.

Now, there is a significant and growing number of GPR users who are

not highly educated in radar principles or signal processing, but who are

utilising GPR on a regular basis for the purpose of utility detection. In

many cases they have received little training and may be skeptical of the

capabilities of their equipment. Some operators only use GPR at its

minimum capability, simply to comply with regulations or as a result of

a lack of knowledge and understanding of the extent of GPR

applications. This in turn often results in inadequate outcomes.

In order to address this shortfall, in partnership with industry (Blue Hat

Training), the University of Greenwich is offering GPR training in the

form of a two day course consisting of presentation, discussion, coaching

and practical outdoor tuition, using the university’s available facilities

and infrastructure.

2. COURSE CONTENT

The formal aspect of training (lectures) explains the principles of a GPR

system, outlining the system’s operation, control and referencing as well

as data processing (basic and intermediate). For example, the material

presented explains why a hyperbola looks the way it does, elaborating

upon factors affecting GPR reflections and why and how these influence

the results (outcome). This new knowledge and understanding is then

applied in the discussion and coaching part of the course.

The course then moves from formal presentation to discussion about the

capabilities and limitations of a GPR system, covering what can and

cannot be identified in terms of targets as well as characteristics of

different targets and their configurations within the processed data.

The discussions then lead into the coaching sessions, using the

university’s GPR system and facilities. This provides ample opportunity

to trainees to underpin the principles of what they have been taught in

class with reality. This involves the location and identification of several

targets around the university campus. As a former naval base, the

University of Greenwich Medway Campus is ideal for this purpose,

45



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





having a diverse spread of utilities and ground conditions dispersed

around the site.

After successfully coaching the operators to locate and identify targets,

the final part of the course is outdoor tuition: how to perform and

operate GPR in application to the utility survey in accordance with TSA

(The Survey Association in the UK) guidelines, level 4. Utilising the

standard grid system and soft chalk for an on-site mark out survey, the

trainees will comprehensively scan the ground to map all the utilities in

a given location.

In order to ensure that all participants get sufficient time with the

equipment, course numbers are limited to eight trainees and

approximately one day of the course is spent outdoors.

In the latter part of the training, trainees are examined and graded;

certificates and performance reports are subsequently issued to their

employers.

The idea for GPR training was first conceived in September 2013 and it

has taken over six months of course and facility preparation including

multiple visits and meetings with Blue Hat and mapping the

underground features of all of the training areas in the university to

prepare the coaching routes and survey sites.

The main feature of this training can be summarised as a unique and

hands-on opportunity for GPR users to enhance their understanding of

the system’s operations and applications. This has led to a well

balanced and highly appreciated course by trainees in terms of the

emphasis on practical experience and understanding gained.

The course covers a variety of content including recognising different

targets such as the examples in Figures 1 and 2. In Table I, the

approximate GPR penetration depth is reported, for different materials.

In Figure 4, the course flyer is shown.

The first GPR training course was successfully completed in April 2014

for a number of trainees, with excellent feedback from participants.

Bookings are already in place for repeat courses in May, June and July.

“COST INITIATIVES FOR EARLY-STAGE RESEARCHERS:

SHORT-TERM SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS, TRAINING SCHOOLS, CONFERENCE

GRANTS, AND TARGETED NETWORK TN1301 (SCI-GENERATION)”

Abstract

Supporting Early-Stage Researchers (ESRs) to develop independent careers

and to establish their first research group under their own responsibility is

a strategic priority for COST [1].

For COST, the definition of ESR is based on the time that elapses between

the date of the PhD (or equivalent experience) and the date of involvement

in a COST Action. If this time span is less than 8 years, a person fits the

definition; of course, periods of career’s leave have to be added to the

mentioned time span.

In this work, four COST instruments, particularly interesting for ESRs, are

presented: Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs), Training Schools (TS),

Conference Grants, and the Targeted Network TN1301. ESRs willing to

receive more information are strongly encouraged to take contact with the

Action Chair and the Action STSM Manager.

1. SHORT-TERM SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS

Short Term Scientific Missions (STSM) are aimed at supporting

individual mobility, strengthening networks and fostering collaborations.

They allow scientists to visit an institution or laboratory in another

COST Country participating to the Action, or in an approved Near

Neighbour Country (NNC) institution, or else in an approved IPC

institution. A STSM should specifically contribute to the scientific

objectives of the Action offering the grant, while at the same time

allowing applicants to learn new techniques or gain access to specific

instruments and/or methods not available in their own institutions.

The evaluation of STSM applications is performed by the Management

Committee (MC) of the Action providing the grant; the MC of the COST

Action TU1208 formally delegated the evaluation of STSM applications to

the Action Chair and the STSM Manager. The selection of applicants is

based on the scientific scope of the STSM application, that must be in

line with the Action objectives, and on the applicant CV. Geographical

and gender balance issues are taken into consideration as well.

49



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





STSM applicants must be engaged in a research programme as a

postgraduate student or postdoctoral fellow, or be employed by or

officially affiliated to an institution or legal entity. This institution is

considered as the Home institution. Institutions may be public or private

entities.

Standard STSMs need to take place according to the following rules:

1. Be a minimum duration of 5 days;

2. Be a maximum duration of 90 days;

3. Carried out in their entirety within a single grant period and within

the Action’s lifetime.

ESRs may extend the duration of the STSM beyond the 90 days (the

maximum allowed duration is 180 days), in well justified cases. The

justifications are to be documented in the approval of the STSM.

A STSM grant is a fixed contribution, based on the budget requested by

the applicant and on the evaluation of the application by the MC Chair

and STSM Manager. The aim of the grant is to support the costs

associated with the exchange visit. It will not necessarily cover all

expenses and has to be intended as a contribution to the travel and

subsistence costs of the participant. A maximum of EUR 2500,00 in

total can be afforded to the grantee, in case of a standard STSM. For an

ESR STSM lasting more than 91 days, instead, the maximum grant is

EUR 3500,00.

More detailled information on STSMs can be found in [2], Section 6.



During Year 1 of the Action TU1208, 4 STSMs were funded and

successfully carried out; 100% of the granted scientists were ESRs or

PhD Students and perfect gender balance was achieved.

Carrying out a STSM is a very positive and fruitful experience, both from

the personal and the professional point of view. ESRs participating to the

COST Action TU1208 are strongly encouraged to apply for a STSM grant!

2. TRAINING SCHOOLS

Training Schools (TSs) aim at widening, broadening and sharing

knowledge relevant to the Action’s objectives, through the delivery of

intensive training on a new and emerging subject. They can offer

familiarisation with unique equipment or expertise that are typically to

the benefit of ESR, although not exclusively. They are not intended to

provide general training or education.

COST support covers the organisation costs of TSs, as well as the

participation of trainees (by assigning grants) and trainers (by

reimbursing travel, accommodation and meal expenses).

More detailled information on TSs can be found in [2], Section 7.

During Year 1 of the Action TU1208, 2 TSs were organized; 100% of the

granted scientists were ESRs or PhD Students, with a perfect gender

balance among them.

A. The first TS focused on “Microwave Imaging and Diagnostics: Theory,

Techniques, Applications.” It was held in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy,

on March 24-28, 2014. It was co-organised by the Action TU1208, the

Action TD1301 “Development of a European-based Collaborative

Network to Accelerate Technological, Clinical and Commercialisation

Progress in the Area of Medical Microwave Imaging,” and the European

School of Antennas (ESoA).

51



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





B. The second TS covered the state of the art and new trends on radar

technologies: “Future Radar Systems: Radar2020.” It was held in the

Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 5-9,

2014. This school was co-organised by the Action TU1208, the ESoA,

and the European Microwave Association (EuMA).

The next planned TU1208 schools will be:

C. A TS on “Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar,”

to be held in the School of Engineering of the Univerity of Pisa and in

IDS Ingegneria dei Sistemi, on September 22-25, 2014. This school will

be fully organised by the Action TU1208.

D. A TS on “Ultra Wide-Band Antennas, Technologies and Applications,”

to be held in Karlsruhe on April 20-24, 2015. This school will be co-

organised by the Action TU1208, the ESoA and the European

Association on Antennas and Propagation (EurAAP).

Note that scientists can attend a TS (and possibly receive a grant) even if

they aren’t involved in the Action organising it. ESRs participating to the

Action TU1208 are strongly encouraged to participate to the TU1208

schools as well as to check the websites of the other running Actions, in

order to find out whether schools of their interest are going to be

organised in the next future.

3. CONFERENCE GRANTS

Each COST Scientific Domain offers to ESRs 3 supporting grants per

year (max. 3000 € each), to participate in an international conference

outside of the COST Action activities.

In order to be eligible for this grant, an accepted oral contribution is

required. The grant can be used to cover travel and subsistence costs,

conference fees, and the costs of conference workshops. A written

application has to be submitted through the Action Chair to the COST

Office. The application must contain the personal data and curriculum

vitae of the applicant, a short description of the involvement in the COST

Action, information on the conference to which the applicant wishes to

participate, a copy of the abstract/paper submitted to the conference

and a proof of acceptance of this contribution by the conference, and

finally the amount of the support needed.

There is a call for Conference Grants three times per year. Each time a

grant per Scientific Domain is assigned.

More information on COST Conference Grant can be found in [3].

The ESRs participating to the COST Action TU1208 are strongly

encouraged to apply.

4. TARGETED NETWORK TN1301

COST Targeted Networks are CSO (Committee of Senior Officials)-driven

Actions, aiming to strengthen the role that COST plays in a given policy

domain (inclusiveness, early-stage researchers' involvement, gender

balance, international cooperation), stimulate the strategic development

of future-oriented societal challenges, and contribute to EU2020 policy

goals [4].

There are currently three COST Targeted Networks, running since 2012:

• TN1201 –

genderSTE (Gender, Science, Technology and

Environment), started in November 2012 and ending in November

2016;

• TN1301 –

Sci-GENERATION (Next Generation of Young

Scientist: Towards a Contemporary Spirit of R&I), started in

November 2013 and ending in November 2017;

• TN1302 –

BESTPRAC (The Voice of Research Administrators -

Building a Network of Administrative Excellence), started in

October 2013 and ending in October 2017.



Anyone interested in joining a Targeted Network is invited to contact the

Action Chair and, subsequently, the COST National Coordinator.

In this paper, we wish to focus on the TN1301, exclusively dedicated to

excellent next-generation scientists in order to help them dealing with

the limitation and obstacles they run across on a daily basis, as they

strive towards an outstanding research career.

The Targeted Network Sci-GENERATION aims at elaborating

contemporary scientific thought and thereby disseminating a new spirit

of research and innovation in Europe, at enhancing career perspectives

for young researchers in public research centres and universities

(particularly from less research-intensive countries), at promoting new

and emergent research topics as well as research methods and

organization, and at improving synergy and avoid duplication of efforts

between organisations, universities and other EU platforms.

The network is structured in 4 Working Groups (WGs). WG1 aims to

propose measures for countries with fewer opportunities for next

generation researchers to increase the visibility, inclusivity and success

of their excellent young European researchers and research teams. WG2

fosters continuity in funding opportunities and career perspectives, as a

result of combined national and European funding schemes. WG3 deals

with promoting new and emergent research topics, as well as research

methods and organisation. Finally, WG4 is concerned with producing a

mapping of EU Science policies, initiatives and associations.

encouraged to read more about the TN1301 on www.scigeneration.eu.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Excellent young researchers in many European countries lack the

visibility and administrative or organisational support crucial for

developing their scientific career. This applies particularly to certain

countries within Southern and Eastern Europe, where working

conditions or a hierarchical mentality have often motivated qualified

young researchers to emigrate to Northern-Western Europe or overseas.

For COST, supporting ESRs to develop independent careers, to establish

their first research group under their own responsibility, and to network

with colleagues in different countries, is a strategic priority, which is

effectively and concretely pursued.

The COST Targeted Network Sci-GENERATION, together with interesting

COST networking tools as Short-Term Scientific Missions, Training

Schools and Conference Grants were presented in this paper.

KEYNOTE TALK 1 - “NETTUN AND ORFEUS PROJECTS”



Guido Manacorda (IT) - g.manacorda@idscorporation.com



The NeTTUN (Leading the Way in New Technology for the Tunnelling

Industry) project has received funding from the European Union’s

Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development

and demonstration, under grant agreement no. 280712 –

www.nettun.org (September 2012 – March 2017). The ORFEUS

(Optimised Radar to Find Every Utility in the Street) project has received

funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for

research, technological development and demonstration, under grant

agreement no. 308356 – www.orfeus.org (October 2012 – March 2015)

NeTTUN addresses tunnelling works, ORFEUS the installation of pipes

with horisontal directional drilling (HDD). Both applications rely upon

data collected from the surface, the scenarios are different but danger is

the same: “blind” digging is anyway a risk! GPR has been experimented

in both these applications, but not concurrently with digging. When

used from the surface, the GPR detection range is limited. Both NeTTUN

and ORFEUS address the installation of GPR on the cutting head in a

very harsh environment. Automatic detection is also required.

Abstract

This paper aims at investigating two aspects: first, the evaluation of

electromagnetic radiation intensity to which humans operating with ground

penetrating radar are exposed; the second topic is to investigate effects of

electromagnetic interferences of specific devices, such as cellular phones,

and transceivers built on the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY layers.



1. INTRODUCTION

GPR systems operate from 10 MHz up to 5 GHz, with about a decade of

bandwidth within that range, so placing themselves into the most

extreme class of ultra-wideband (UWB) radars. In order to evaluate the

electromagnetic emissions, comparing them to the limits that now exist

in a number of jurisdictions, recent studies have focused on the basic

steps needed to translate UWB GPR’s results into regulatory parameters

[1]. When analyzing a GPR we need to distinguish two functional

aspects: operation as intentional radiator, and Electromagnetic

Compatibility (EMC) requirements which equipment must satisfy. As

deliberate radio frequency radiator, it can be assimilated to a Short

Range Device (SRD), such as movement detectors and metal detectors,

covered by the R&TTE Directive of European Commission [2]. Regarding

EMC issues, emission requirements of equipment are defined by “Comité

international spécial des perturbations radioélectriques” (CISPR) [3], and

74





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





those of immunity by the International Electrotechnical Commission

(IEC) committees. European Telecommunications Standards Institute

(ETSI) published standards on compatibility, and ground- and wall-

probing radar applications, approved by the European National

Standards Organizations in form of European Norm (EN). Specifically,

ETSI Standard EN-302066-1 V1.2.1 [4] defines technical characteristics,

and test methods, whereas ETSI Standard EN-302066-2 V1.2.1 [5]

harmonizes requirements of an article of R&TTE Directive.

This work presents experimental test implementations for verifying how

mobile phones and other common sources of possible interference can

contaminate GPR data, and how to post-process the data in order to

filter such interference effects. Among the interfering devices, XBee

transceivers, based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard, are considered, since

participants of Project 4.2 intend to combine them with a GPR, mounted

on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), for wireless communication of the

detection and localisation of people buried under avalanche.

Considering that GPR systems:

• are not operated for extended duration and their mean radiated

power is very low;

• are often used in areas where the density of population is low;

• are designed to radiate energy into the ground, where it is quickly

absorbed (Fig. 1);

• are often equipped with a shut-off switch that automatically stops

the radiation when the radar is lifted from the ground surface, or

is not operated in the proper position;

interference is very rare and the human health protection issue is

ignored. Nevertheless, when GPR application is exactly the people

detection, this issue cannot be overlooked. Therefore, another focus of

the work is to quantify the exposure of GPR operators to electromagnetic

waves emitted by the radar, for human health protection.

Figure 2 shows the devices under test: the SIR2000, a GPR model by

Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI), and the SUB-ECHO HBD 300

antenna by Radarteam Sweden AB factory.

SIR2000 is a single channel general-purpose system requiring a 12 V DC

power input at 3 A. It can be used with antennas from 16 MHz to 2000

MHz providing penetration depths ranging from tens of m to a few cm.

The SUB-ECHO HBD 300 antenna operates at 300 MHz as central

frequency. Its frequency boundaries of 3-dB bandwidth are 120-780

MHz. Front to back ratio stated around -14.5 dB. It weighs 4 kg and its

dimension is (L x W x H) 720x360x160 mm.

• FSP30 spectrum analyzer by Rohde Schwarz operating in the

range 9 kHz ÷ 30 GHz;

• E4440 spectrum analyzer by Agilent which works from 3 Hz to

26.5 GHz.



The measurement setup has been completed with:

• preamplifier HP8447F (9 kHz ÷1300 MHz);

• Shuner Sukoflex 100 microwave cables 104 & 106;

Normally, a GPR operator is exposed to the back lobe of the transmitting

antenna, as well as to the signal reflected from soil under investigation.

We considered the worst case, evaluating the electric field transmitted

distance.

Results were collected by supposing that all radiated energy reaches the

operator, along a direct line of maximum electromagnetic radiation,

disregarding the back lobe transmission.

The intensity of the electric field E is evaluated by means of the following

equation (1):



E = ACF ⋅ a

V = ACF ⋅ At Ca

t ble ⋅ r

V

(1)

where: Va is the voltage value across output of receiving antenna, AttCable

defines the cable attenuation, Vr is the voltage intensity measured by the

receiver, and ACF represents the antenna calibration factor.

By using a spectrum analyser (SA), we could measure the signal

spectrum, identify its portion generated by the radar, and evaluate the

peak and average voltage intensity. Furthermore, by exploiting a suitable

setting of the Resolution Bandwidth (RBW) of our SA, we could put in

evidence the actual radar pulses. In Figure 6, typical pulses generated

by the GPR are shown, in time and frequency domains. The SIR2000

GPR generates single pulses that have a time duration of about 2.7 ns

and a variable Pulse Repetition Time (PRT = T). Measures carried out in

the controlled room confirm the presence of spectral traces separated

among them by a constant PRF = 1/T (Pulse Repetition Frequency), as

shown in Figure 7.

Two SA modes are possible, depending on the ratio between bandwidth

at 3 dB of IF filter (RBW), and frequency distance between contiguous

spectral rows, as shown in Fig. 8. These two procedures are named: line

spectrum mode and pulse spectrum mode.

When we operate by using the line spectrum mode, the analyzer

DPCM (Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian

Republic) July 8, 2003 is the Italian rule regarding exposure of people to

the electromagnetic fields. Nevertheless, it regulates only the cases of

telecommunication fixed services (art. 1). However, in the case of pulsed

signal, the same decree at subsection no. 4 recommends to adopt the

European Recommendation (July 12, 1999). This rule, conformable to

the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation

Protection), evaluates maximum power density (S) as the average power

density multiplied by factor 1000. This is equivalent to multiply the

average electric field by the factor 32 for obtaining maximum electric

field, at identical frequency obviously. Similarly, D. Lgs (Legislative

Decree) 81-2008, conformable to the rule CE 2004/40, regulates worker

exposure. Specifically, in the frequency range 10 MHz÷300 GHz, peak

values are evaluated by multiplying the rms values by factors 32 and

1000, respectively for electric field and power density of the equivalent

plane wave.



When the voltage receiver is expressed in dBm, we can use the equation:





E( dBV / m) = ACF( dB)+ AttCable( dB)+ Vr ( dBm)−13 (3) In our experimental results, the value of electrical field peak has been

measured equal to Epeak = 1.7 mV.

GPR’s setup can be changed. In the case of setup as 900TAS, 300S,

2500HHS, we measured a PRT of 12 µs, different from that shown when

setup is 500DPH (PRT=23.3 µs).

3. INTERFERENCE TESTING ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP A GPR APPLICATION:

DETECTION OF PEOPLE UNDER AVALANCHES



The detection and precise localization of people buried or!trapped under

avalanche or debris is an emerging field of application of GPR [6÷11]. In

the last years, processing approaches and technological solutions have

been developed to improve detection accuracy, speed up localization, and

reduce false alarms. In case of emergency scenario for avalanche,

improvement of these three aspects is fundamental for increasing

probability of survivals. Indeed, the survival time is very short, since the

82





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





relative probability decreases to 90, 40 and 30 per cent, if the victim is

removed from the snow within 15, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. So,

radar at direct contact with the snow surface is not a viable option. In

fact, moving radar systems on a mountain slope run over by avalanche

is particularly complicated, due to the presence of bulky slabs of ice

mixed with snow. Therefore, placing the radar just on the snow is not

fast enough for using it during emergency.

In order to solve this problem, since 2005 researchers have considered a

GPR system mounted on an airborne platform [12÷14], e.g. helicopter

shown in Fig. 10, or UAV in the future. Especially for the last case, there

is need to add electronic devices to the basic GPR system. These

subsystems allow wireless communication between GPR and operating

unit, located on the snowy surface or inside a control room.

In order to evaluate interferences generated by transmitters located near

the GPR antenna, we organized two different measurements, in the

presence of a cellular phone and of a XBee transceiver.

The first test concerned an UMTS cellular phone. The distance between

the GPR antenna and the phone was 1.4 m. Fig. 11 shows radargram

output (3849 scans), in absence (a) and in presence (b) of the cellular

transmission. Fig. 12 shows the oscilloscope representation, allowing us

to put in evidence a very limited spread of traces.

For the second test, a transceiver XBee PRO-S2 (international variant by

Digi International), is arranged on the top at direct contact with GPR's

antenna, as shown in Fig. 13. Specifications of the RF module are:

transmitting power output 10 mW, outdoor RF LOS range 1500 m,

operating frequency band ISM 2.4 GHz, RF data rate 250 kbps, 14 direct

sequence channels.

The radargram of Fig. 14 shows a first interval of data acquisition with

the XBee in off state, and a following interval characterized by the XBee

continuously transmitting.

Both tests demonstrate a very low interference generated by the devices,

due to the fact that their operating frequency bands are different from

the GPR bandwidth. Therefore, the design for adding wireless

communication devices to the GPR is justified.

The main focus of this work was the accurate and realistic

implementation of GPR antennas into a FDTD model. During the Second

General Meeting, this work was presented as a poster.



The main challenges in electromagnetic modelling of GPR for civil-

engineering applications are A) the implementation of the dielectric

properties of the media (soils, concrete, etc.) in a realistic way; B) the

implementation of the geometry of the media (soils inhomogeneities,

rough surface, vegetation, concrete features like fractures and rock

fragments, etc.); and, C) the detailed modelling of the antenna units.



Accurate models based on general characteristics of the commercial

antennas GSSI 1.5 GHz and MALA 1.2 GHz have been already

incorporated in GprMax, a free software which solves Maxwell’s equation

using a second order in space and time FDTD algorithm [1-3].



The present work was concerned with the implementation of horn

antennas with different geometrical parameters, as well as ridged horn

antennas, into the FDTD model. Realistic models of soils and concrete

were used to test and compare different horn-antenna units. In

particular, stochastic methods were used in order to realistically

simulate the geometrical characteristics of the medium. Regarding the

dielectric properties, Debye approximations were adopted in order to

simulate the frequency-dispersive properties of the medium within the

frequency range of interest.

1. SOME GROUND PENETRATING RADAR THEORY



The GPR system transmits and receives pulses of electromagnetic

energy. The signal reflected from interfaces in the pavement gives

information about subsurface conditions.

Typical GPR reflections from a pavement are sketched below:





A0 can be used to calculate the dielectric constant of the surface layer

and Δt1 to calculate the layer thickness. Similarly, A1 and Δt1 can be used

to calculate the dielectric constant and thickness of the second layer.

Finally, A1 can provide the dielectric constant of the third layer.

Changes in pavement condition have effects on the radar signal, as

resumed in Table I.

CONCLUSIONS

The higher is the frequency, the higher are the observed dielectric

constant values, both for the IDS antenna and the GSSI air-coupled

antenna. A great variation of dielectric constant values was obtained for

saturated and partially saturated conditions. For fine soil, the collected

values show a linear increment of the dielectric constant as the water

content increases, for all the used GPR systems. For fouled ballast,

results show a linear increment for both the fouling levels and the water

content variation, in different proportion: dielectric constant is more

affected by fouling variation than by water content.

For in situ validation, the dielectric constant of clean ballast is

consistent with the values obtained in laboratory. The main problem for

fouling layers evaluation is the presence of other materials, such as old

limestone ballast that increased the dielectric constant of the material.

Abstract

The wide-ranging flexibility of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), makes it

one of the most effective and efficient tools in several fields of application,

including pavement engineering. In such increasingly established

framework, the evaluation of mechanical properties of road pavements

directly from electromagnetic surveys could represent a real breakthrough

toward a more efficient management of the road asset. According to the

above, a pulsed GPR system with ground-coupled antennas, 600 MHz and

1600 MHz center frequencies of investigation, was employed over a

4m×30m flexible pavement test site, composed of an 836-nodes grid.

Elastic moduli were measured at each node using a light falling weight

deflectometer (LFWD), as ground-truth data for both model calibration and

validation. Data processing has foreseen to construct a 3-D matrix of the

scanned area, wherein a number of C-scans was extracted up to a

maximum depth z = 200 mm, according to the influence domain of the

LFWD. From the calibration procedure, a number of signal amplitude

values was picked and related to a consistent amount of grid points

randomly selected within each sampled C-scan. Similarly, amplitude

values from other randomly selected nodes, in the same number than the

calibration step, were also picked in order to validate such semi-empirical

model. The comparison between observed and predicted elastic moduli

shows a relatively good matching. Future developments of the research

could lead to a system calibration in laboratory, under known conditions,

and to the use of different center frequencies of investigation.





INTRODUCTION


A strong relationship between the frequency of road accidents and the

presence of pavement surface damages has been widely investigated over

time [20]. Several causes involve the loss of strength and deformation

properties of pavements, ranging from environmental conditions, such

as precipitations or freezing, to traffic loads [13, 18].

129

Strength and deformation properties of pavements are traditionally

evaluated through destructive techniques, although they have

demonstrated a low efficiency in terms of costs and time, as well as of

results reliability. In such a scenario, the use of a non-destructive

technique such as falling weight deflectomer (FWD) has significantly

increased over the past few decades [4]. Basically, the functioning of this

tool, included its portable version named light falling weight

deflectometer (LFWD) [2], is based on the application of a load through a

circular plate coupled to the ground, and on the sensing of the relevant

echoes coming from the surface by means of ground-coupled geophones.

The structural conditions of the pavement and any weaknesses of its

layers are therefore assessed through the deflection bowl retrieved from

these echoes. In this regard, Benedetto et al. [10] analyzed the influence

domain of deflections related to LFWD tests on several subgrade soils.

Such instrument has also demonstrated to be really promising in the

field of ruts prediction in unpaved natural soils [6].

Amongst the several non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, ground-

penetrating radar (GPR) is increasingly established in evaluating the

physical properties of the subsurface. This electromagnetic tool basically

relies on the transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves in a

fixed frequency-band [12, 22]. Applications of GPR can range from

agriculture to archaeology, up to many fields of engineering and beyond

[15]. In pavement engineering, it is possible to count several GPR

applications, spanning from the assessment of deterioration in HMA

layers [5, 19] or deeper layers [9], up to the evaluation of the health state

of concrete structures [7, 14]. In addition, recent investigations have

focused on the assessment of those properties causing structural

damages in pavements, such as moisture and clay [1, 11, 17, 21].

In this framework, new challenging frontiers could be more deeply

explored in the field of relating dielectric and mechanical properties of

materials [16]. Basically, this issue has herein been tackled relying on

the undeniable dependence between mechanical characteristics of soils

and friction between soil particles, and on the assumption that the

dielectric behavior is related to the bulk density of soils [16].



OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

In this work, GPR data were collected in a test site of 4m×30m, with a

flexible pavement structure, in order to retrieve the Young’s modulus

values of the pavement. For this purpose, EM data were related to the

observed values of E by LFWD, for both calibration and validation

procedures. A semi-empirical prediction model is then described and

results are discussed.

EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK

The test site consists of a 4m×30m flexible pavement structure, that can

be broadly described as follows:

- General information: the test site is located at the Department of

Engineering of Roma Tre University, Rome. The elevation above the

sea level is 11.5 m.

-

Vertically (in-depth structure): the cross-section consists of an 80

mm of hot mix asphalt (HMA) layer, 100 mm of bitumen-bound base

and 100 mm of unbound sub-base [8] (Figure 1). The absence of

metallic targets below the surface was ensured by former surveys.

-

Horizontally (surface structure): a square mesh grid of 76×11 nodes

was realized, with a step of 0.4 m each other, for overall 836 nodes.

The longitudinal slope can be considered as broadly flat. Former

visual inspections of the pavement revealed general good conditions,

with a 62 m2 of repaved zone, at the last 12m of the test site.

-

The EM surveys were developed using a pulsed GPR system with two

ground-coupled antennas, 600 MHz and 1600 MHz center frequencies of

investigation (RIS 99-MF system realized by IDS S.p.A., Italy). Data were

collected with two mono-static and two bi-static channels, in the time

domain, providing a 40.076 ns time-window. The time step for data

acquisition was dt = 7.8273×10-2 ns, with the horizontal resolution of

131



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





data sampling set as 2.4×10-2 m. Data collected with the 1600 MHz

antenna were used for cross-checking, while data from the 600 MHz

antenna were post-processed, according to the LFWD domain of

influence. Overall, 11 longitudinal and 76 transversal tracks were

surveyed, for a total amount of 26415 radar traces.

In addition, mechanical surveys were carried out using a Prima 100

LFWD, manufactured by Carl Bro Pavement Consultants Kolding,

Denmark. The instrument is made of a metal plate (diameter 100 mm )

loaded by a 10kg hammer, and geophone sensors enabling to measure

deflections c. The elastic Young’s modulus E is calculated by using the

Boussinesq solution, as follows:

! = !(!!!!)!"





(1)

!!

where k equals 2 or / 2 for flexible and rigid pavements, respectively; c

being the deflection at the center of the plate [ m], being the load

stress [MPa], and R being the plate radius [mm]. LFWD tests were

developed during five days, in the same period of GPR measurements.

Basically, a number of six LFWD measurements was performed on each

grid node, to retrieve more stable and reliable mechanical data by

statistical analyses [3].

PREDICTION MODEL

In order to perform a proper calibration of the model, LFWD and GPR

data have been formerly processed with the aim of minimizing the

instability of results and increasing the compatibility of both mechanical

and EM data.

Concerning the LFWD measurements, the reliability of the observed

values of Young’s modulus EOBS node in the grid was increased by

applying a 10% trimmed mean to the above six measurements, node by

node.

On other hand and with regards to the EM data, a depth zero filtering

was applied to each trace, which was in turn averaged amongst the

neighborhood traces collected alongside the longitudinal and transverse

direction of acquisition, with spatial lengths of +0.20 m and -0.20 m

from each sensing point. Under the hypothesis of an average standard

value of wave propagation velocity equals to 10 cm/ns, it was possible to

build a 3D matrix of the signal. The comparison between such 3D

amplitudes matrix and the EOBS matrix can be considered as the base of

the modeling process. The generic value of predicted elastic modulus Ex,y

related to a certain general position [ x, y] on the grid is defined by the following equation:

with !!,!,!

being the generic value of signal amplitude, normalized in

the range [0,1]. !! is a coefficient depending on the depth, that takes

into account the interaction between the attenuation of the signal and

the contribution of the material, at a generic depth, to the pavement

elastic response. !!"# is defined as 0.2 m, according to the domain of

influence of LFDW. ! is a scale coefficient allowing to retrieve the

absolute Ex,y value, from the normalized one, while !! and ! are

amplification coefficients whose values are calibrated by minimizing

errors between EOBS and Ex,y through an empirically-based reciprocal

regression process.

CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION OF THE MODEL

With the aim of both minimizing computational efforts and properly

describing the relationship between GPR and LFWD results, four C-

scans from the 3D amplitudes matrix were sampled at fixed depths,

namely, the interfaces between air and pavement surface, HMA and base

layers, base and sub-base layers, sub-base and subgrade. The

calibration of the model according to Equation (2) was performed by

randomly selecting 24 points within the 836 nodes of the grid and by

running the reciprocal regression process. The model was then validated

by randomly selecting 24 further nodes amongst the measured data.

A good estimate of elastic moduli by the EM data was observed, both for

high and low values of EOBS. Comparison between observed and

predicted values of elastic modulus is shown in Figure 2. The

determination coefficient R2 between observed and predicted values

amounts to 0.87, as shown in Figure 3.



MAIN RESULTS

An observed elastic modulus map was realized by interpolating the

LFWD measurements (Figure 4a). Overall, the maximum and minimum

values observed of the population are below and above 3200 MPa and

350 MPa, respectively, with an average value and a standard deviation of

around 1020 MPa and 390 MPa. Four main areas characterized by

highest values of strength can be identified, namely, [ x, y]=[4.8m, 2.0m],

[ x,

y]=[21.6m÷22.8m,0.8m÷1.6m],

[ x,

y]=[24.4m,

4.0m],

[ x,

y]=[26.4m÷29.6m, 0.8m÷2.0m]. Moreover, the middle area of the test site

133

(2.4m < x < 17.6m) shows average E values ranging from 1300 MPa to

1900 MPa. Analogous values can be observed for the area defined by

18.4 m < x < 22.8 m and y> 1.2 m. Lowest values of E can be identified alongside the longitudinal upper and lower edges, from x = 0.0 m to x =

20.0 m, and from x = 23.6 m to x = 30.0 m.





FIG. 2 − Comparison between observed and predicted Young’s moduli for

the validation process.





FIG. 3 − Determination coefficient between observed and predicted

values of Young’s modulus.



On other hand, by interpolating the prediction model results it was

possible to build up a map of predicted elastic moduli (Figure 4b). The

predicted population shows maximum, minimum and average values of

≈3000 MPa, ≈340 MPa and ≈1230 MPa, respectively, with a standard

deviation

E

≈435 MPa, thereby confirming a good reliability of

OBS

predictions. Comparing these two maps, a good match can be identified

in the area edged by 1.2 m < y < 2.0 m and 27.6 m < x < 29.6 m with E > 134





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





2600 MPa. Such an area corresponds to that one interested by past

repaving works, as identified by former visual inspections. Analogously,

another good match can be observed alongside the longitudinal

centerline of the test site, bounded by 2.4 m < x < 22.4 m . Here,

medium-high values of elastic modulus (1300÷1900 MPa) can be

reasonably related to compaction procedures carried out under

construction, that perform traditionally better in the longitudinal

direction as well as in the center of the pavement cross section, due to

the absence of edge effects from the compactors. In addition, good

correspondences can be identified alongside the upper and lower edges

of the test site.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, a semi-empirical predictive model for evaluating

mechanical properties of pavement by non-destructive GPR surveys is

presented [9, 16]. For this purpose, a flexible pavement test site with

dimensions 4m×30m was investigated, by surveying an 836 nodes

square mesh grid, being 0.40 m the spacing between each scan.

The calibration of the model was performed by relating the LFWD

measurements, collected on 24 randomly sampled nodes, and the signal

amplitudes from GPR data, within the depth of influence of the LFWD.

The validation of the model was obtained by randomly selecting 24

further nodes and by minimizing the errors between observed and

predicted values. A determination coefficient R2 = 0.87 along with a

general good matching of both high and low E values were shown. In

addition, the comparison between the two elastic modulus maps has

proved to be really promising.

Although some mismatches are identified and need to be further refined,

the model shows good perspectives in order to achieve large-scale

evaluations of pavement mechanical properties through GPR

inspections. Further studies can be devoted on considering non-constant

propagation velocity values of the electromagnetic signal through the

material, i.e., in multi-layered configurations of pavements.

Abstract

Among the effects of the Global Economic Crisis, it is possible to count a

growth of the demand for Non-Destructive Technologies (NDTs). This is

mainly due to their high performances, whereby they allow to collect many

data over large distances, such as in case of road pavement inspections, in

a really shortened time range and with relatively low financial efforts. In

this research work, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data collected on a

rural road network were analysed. Analyses were carried out twice, with a

seven-month time span each other, with the main goals to i) detect critical

sections for road unsafety conditions occurrence; ii) monitor the evolution of

existing damages and evaluate early-stage deep failures, even though not

visible at the ground level; iii) interpret the impact of human factors in

accident occurrence instead of environmental factors. An instrumented van

supporting a 1GHz GPR air-launched horn antenna was employed to

collect data at traffic speed. The reliability of results was enhanced by

cross-checking multiple data from different support technologies (e.g. GPS,

odometer, HD video camera). Lastly, GPR data were processed and pave-

ment layers identified. Results show promising perspectives in predicting

pavement damages evolution, paving the way to further implementation of

prediction models for assessing residual life-cycle of pavements.





INTRODUCTION


As a result of an overall decrease of economic resources for

infrastructural asset maintenance, public administrations are

progressively reshaping their investment strategies towards the

application of more time- and cost-efficient technologies, focused at

optimizing both maintenance and rehabilitation processes.

With regard to pavement engineering purposes, the need for effective and

efficient management and maintenance operations involves more crucial

issues, which can be mainly related to social costs due to deaths and

injuries from car accidents. Poor conditions of pavement surface have

been identified as among the main causes of driving unsafety [22].

139



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





In line with this, cracks, potholes and surface deformations with related

water ponding, usually cause a lowering of friction between vehicle tires

and pavement surface due to vertical accelerations, thereby contributing

to increase poor safety conditions of driving. In this scenario, it seems

quite evident how proper pavement management actions could lead to

both effective uses of resources and significant reductions of car

accidents by preventing the causes of damages. Accordingly, NTD s are

nowadays the most widespread techniques employed in road

rehabilitations. Amongst them, it is worth citing the light falling weight

deflectometer (LFWD) as a useful tool for evaluating the mechanical

properties of subsurface [3, 8], while many applications on moisture

content rely on the use of time domain reflectometry (TDR) [19]. Despite

a relatively high reliability of results achieved through the above

systems, GPR-based surveys broadly enable a huge gathering of data in

relatively low time periods, directly on site. [6, 20]. Several GPR

applications are carried out in the field of pavement engineering.

Amongst them, we can cite the detection of subsurface voids [16], the

investigation of layer thicknesses [1] and delamination in concrete

structures [10, 14], the detection of rebars [12, 13], the positioning of

underground utilities [4], asphalt stripping evaluation [21] and bridges

monitoring [7]. The assessment of volumetric water content in pavement

structures [2], load-bearing layers and subgrade soils [5, 9, 11, 15, 23]

are further important issues that have been tackled by using GPR

techniques, as well as the evaluation of clay content in soils, that causes

unwanted plasticity effects [17, 23]. In addition, several studies have

dealt with the potential of off-ground GPR configurations, which enable

large-scale efficient road surveys [18, 20].

METHODOLOGY AND OBJECTIVES

In this work, the reliability and efficiency of an off-ground GPR radar

system have been tested at the large-scale of investigation. Radar

surveys have involved about 320 km of roads, with the aim to infer

information about layers arrangement, along with the main causes and

the evolution of visible and hidden damages. In order to investigate this

latter, surveys were performed twice, 320 km and 160 km length,

respectively, at a time distance of about seven months.

TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT

Radar data were collected using the RIS Hi-Pave HR1 1000 GPR system,

manufactured by IDS S.p.A., Italy, working with one mono-static off-

ground antenna, 1GHz center frequency of investigation. The antenna

array was fixed behind an instrumented van, hosting the control unit.

GPS logging of the van trajectories, has ensured the exact positioning of

the GPR data gathered. In addition, the use of an odometer and an HD

video recorder has enabled, respectively, to measure the covered

distance and to provide data processing with visual feedbacks of surface

conditions. Post-processing of the raw data was carried out by using the

GRED 3D software by IDS S.p.A.

SYSTEM CALIBRATION

In order to calibrate the GPR system, preliminary surveys were

performed both in laboratory environment and real-life roads, in order to

ensure a good reliability of the data collected by isolating and filtering

out unwanted signal noise factors. Basically, the calibration parameters

have included i) the radar positioning on the van (i.e., the height of the

antenna array above the ground and its distance from the back of the

van); ii) the acquisition parameters (time window, samples per scan, etc..

); iii) the post-processing procedure (sequence of applied signal filters); iv)

optimal scan length to streamline heavy computational loads. Table 1

synthesizes the optimal configuration retrieved for each of the

aforementioned parameters during system calibration.

DOMAIN OF INVESTIGATION

Inspections were carried out on a rural road network in the District of

Rieti, about 100 km north from Rome, in Italy. The surveyed topography

is mostly characterized by a hilly and mountainous environment.

According to both the center frequency of investigation and the

investigated type of structure, the maximum signal penetration depth is

around 900 mm, which is consistent with the deepest layer interfaces.

Overall, around 320 km were investigated at traffic speed in both travel

directions, on the following routes:

- SR 4 bis – “del Terminillo”: 16 km + 900 m;

- SR 79 – “Ternana”: 17 km + 300 m;

- SR 313 – “Passo Corese”: 45 km + 000 m;

- SR 471 – “di Leonessa”: 32 km + 500 m;

- SR 578 – “Salto Cicolana”: 46 km + 450 m;

All across the considered road network, the road section is mostly

composed by two lanes, 3.5 m wide each, with both left and right

shoulders 0.5 m wide. A typical pavement cross-section consists, on the

average, of a 65mm thick HMA layer, a 100mm thick base layer and a

300mm thick sub-base layer.

APPROACH FOR DATA ANALYSIS

According to the digital filters listed in Table 1, raw data have been

processed firstly in the time domain, in order to remove reflections from

antenna coupling and the air layer separating the source of the signal

and the ground surface, and band pass filters have been subsequently

applied in the frequency domain to reduce the noise. Lastly, signal

amplitudes and their attenuation in depth have been re-modulated

through a standard amplification function.

To develop a proper data analysis, GPR traces were divided into

homogenous sections, due to the combination of the following

parameters:

- considered route;

- cross-section type;

- pavement distress;

- regularity of layer thicknesses kept along considerable distances;

- marked loss of regularity in layers arrangement;

142



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





- widespread overlays and repairs;

- widespread subsurface water presence in the neighborhood of

streams or rivers;

- widespread frost action effects within the pavement structure.



MAIN RESULTS

Since around 320 km have been broadly investigated in two days during

the first set of surveys, and about 160 km during the second one, it is

worth to cite how this off-ground GPR system has shown a very high

productivity of approximately 160 km/day, at the average speed of 40

km/h. In addition, the results from the second set of surveys have

shown a high consistency with those collected during the first one. As

expected, minor changes have been observed in those sections interested

by lower traffic loads, while major evolutions of pavement distresses

were detected very close to water bodies, such as rivers or streams, in

work zones as well as in those sections already damaged in the past. In

this work, GPR surveys related to Routes S.R. 313 and S.R. 578 are

presented as case studies. Concerning Route S.R. 313, Figures 1 and 2

show the GPR scans and relevant photographic reports carried out in

different time periods, on the way to “Terni”. Such two figures relate to

the homogeneous section developing from km 13+400 to km 13+500, for

an overall length of 100 m. Both the radar scans highlight widespread

failures at the subsurface level (i.e., subgrade). The length of this type of

damage is about 50 m. By cross-checking GPR data, HD video camera

and GPS logger, it was easy to verify that such distress is revealed by

surface cracking and potholes over the pavement surface. By means of

figures comparison, it is worthwhile noting that this damage has

suffered a relevant evolution during the 7months interlude. Concerning

Route S.R. 578, the homogeneous section developing between km

40+700 and km 40+800, “Torano” direction, was taken into account. In

contrast to the previous case study of Figure 1, a good matching between

the two radar scans can be found in this case. Pavement faults are

mostly concentrated in load-bearing layers. Although the local

topography suggests possible relevant freeze-thaw cycles affecting the

pavement, GPR and video camera data do not observe relevant

CONCLUSIONS

The effectiveness and efficiency of an air-launched GPR system in a

large-scale road network domain of investigation are analyzed in this

work. Two set of surveys, 320 km and 160 km of length, respectively,

were performed at an average speed of 40 km/h. The GPR system was

calibrated through laboratory and real-life roads tests. Two case studies

are herein presented, concerning two out of five investigated routes of

the rural road network.

EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





The efficiency and effectiveness of such a GPR system have been proved

by both the high productivity of this technology (around 160 km/day)

and the possibility to avoid any traffic flow interruptions. Furthermore,

considerable results were achieved in correctly identifying the

positioning of mismatches in layers arrangement. In line with this, the

comparison between radar scans at different time periods and data

collected through other tools, have confirmed the crucial role of GPR in

identifying the causes of damages, regardless from surface evidences.

Lastly, the repetition of surveys after a significant time period could pave

the way for future GPR-based approaches capable to predict how specific

pavement damages may develop over time, such that the most effective

maintenance actions can be timely implemented.

ITALY

In Eledia Research Centre, inverse scattering techniques for the GPR

data processing are being developed and integrated with multi-scaling

methods. The integration of stochastic and deterministic inversion

algorithms with multi-focusing strategies, in order to produce high-

resolution images with high computational efficiency, is a topic under

study. Inversion techniques based on Bayesian Compressive Sampling

are being developed, suitable to recover sparse objects such as rebar,

cracks and voids inside reinforced concrete, pillars and walls. Further

techniques are being developed, based on the Learning-by-Examples

(LBE) paradigm, for real-time detection, localization and classification of

defects, voids and cracks inside lossy dielectric mediums.

PROGRESS REPORT OF PROJECT 2.3

“INNOVATIVE INSPECTION PROCEDURES FOR EFFECTIVE GPR SENSING AND

MAPPING OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND VOIDS,

WITH A FOCUS TO URBAN AREAS”



Christina Plati (GR), Xavier Deròbert (FR)

xavier.derobert@ifsttar.fr

During the first year of COST action TU1208, the project devoted to

underground utilities and voids detection has been part of a more

general approach followed by the WG2 “GPR surveying of pavements,

bridges, tunnels and buildings, undergrounds utilities and void sensing”.

The work of P2.3, once the applications of utilities and voids dissociated,

has been composed of the following steps:

− state-of-the-art

− test sites

− survey procedures

For the particular case of voids detection, another section has been

added dedicated to case studies.



The state-of-art related to the utilities detection and mapping has been

mainly focused on some references, listed in Plati and Dérobert [1], some

methodologies [2-5] and national standards or common practices [6-9].

the objective herein is to gather such information and compare the

practices from one state to another one.



Another important action, initiated by WG2, has been to design some

questionnaires. The first one being related to the kind of research and

application studied by the actors of COST TU1208. This information has

been gathered by the WP2.1 leader J. Stryk. The second questionnaire

corresponds to a sheet to be filled describing test sites of benchmarks,

used by the partners and that can be at disposal to this action.



One important geophysical test site that can be mentioned is located at

Ifsttar [10]. This site is constituted essentially by a pit length of 30 m

and 5 m in width in bottom with sides sloping to 2/1. Useful depth

varies from 3.30 to 4.70 m. This pit is filled with various materials

arranged in horizontal compacted slices separated by a vertical interface

and water-tighted in surface, such as silt, limestone sand and gravel

156



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





gneiss. The embedded objects are mainly pipes elements, buried at three

depths and polystyren hollows representing some voids.



Some GPR profiles, done at various central frequencies on this test site,

should be available soon on the Website of this COST action. The

objective herein is to propose as well as some typical and controlled GPR

signatures and some examples to be modeled through the WG3.



The second part is devoted to voids created by pipes leaks or breaks, or

by dislocated joints, while draining fine particles of base and sub-base

road structures. The corresponding action follows the same steps than

for the pipes. But as the shape of this kind of voids beneath roadways

can present a wide range of variations (from discompacted materials to

large cavities), the GPR responses vary in the same range order.



Then, the working group provides to design a sheet formular to be

proposed and filled by the COST partners, who have performed such

case studies in real situation. The objective herein is to create a catalog

available to the COST partners.



The survey procedures will be designed in a last step, once the different

actions will be performed and evaluated, including the hardware and

signal or imaging processing, on controlled sites.

PROGRESS REPORT OF PROJECT 2.4

“INNOVATIVE PROCEDURES FOR EFFECTIVE GPR INSPECTION OF

CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES”

Lech Krysinski (PL)

lkrysinski@ibdim.edu.pl

Abstract

This report resumes the current efforts in Project 2.4. The basic information

about participants was collected and a preliminary review of the

methodologies being used by the project participants was provided. Several

interesting laboratories for experimental studies on large samples are

available, for joint activities.

BASIC INFORMATION

The Project 2.4 (WG2) currently has 30 participants from 11 Countries

(Belgium 3, Croatia 3, Denmark 2, Finland 1, France 5, Germany 3,

Greece 5, Italy 4, Poland 2, Portugal 1, Spain 1).

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The project deals with a wide area of problems related to material

properties

determination

in

GPR

inspection

practice.

The

quality/damage characteristics (like cracks and delaminations) are

treated as material characteristics within the project interests. The

structural studies of constructions belong also to the area of interest of

this project, due to their close connections with the determination of the

electromagnetic properties of the materials. The field and laboratory

large scale constructions dedicated to experimental studies of the GPR

response signals are of particular interest for the project.

A special questionnaire dedicated to the topics of the project was

prepared. Based on the answers given by the participants, the

preliminary review of methods being practiced is presented below.

MAIN CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL TYPES, THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND

PATHOLOGIES BEING ESTIMATED BY GPR



Among the most common construction materials, the following

categories are being reported: concretes, masonry, bituminous mixtures,

cobblestones, loose or improved materials like aggregates or sands

159



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





(unbound or reworked), railway ballast, isolation, geotextiles, soils and

reworked soils, frost, rocks, karstic background of constructions like

tunnels or roads, wood. For every category some typical properties,

defects and characteristic problems were identified.

Typical inspection tasks are focused usually on structural aspects like

the determination of layer thickness (depths 0 to 2m), finding out the

position of reinforcement elements and infrastructure, the detection and

localization of defects, construction changes and anomalies. The typical

referred equipment uses time-domain antennas (200MHz to 2.2GHz) or

frequency-domain antennas (Vivaldi and horn antennas, 3DR).

The typical structures being studied by the use of GPR by the project

participants, belong to the following classes:

• Pavements (roads, squares and airport): bituminous pavement,

concrete pavement, unbound aggregate pavement, sub-structures

(covered or not covered), water supply systems.

• Bridges, tunnels, railway infrastructure: concrete and masonry

bridges, retaining walls, tunnels, railway tracks.

• Grounds: soils, frost.

• Buildings: walls, floors and ceilings, columns, balconies, wood

buildings and other constructions.



LABORATORY EQUIPMENT, METHODS AND SYSTEMS BEING USED FOR

ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES ASSESSMENT



The laboratory methods for the estimation of the electromagnetic

properties of the materials belong to two formal categories: GPR based

methods, and auxiliary electromagnetic sensors. Some solutions (like

TDR) have intermediate character.

GPR based methods (reflectometry, refractometry, transition systems,

WARR, CMP methods):

• GPR Frequency-domain and time-domain, full inversion method.

• Large-sample measurements to analyse reflection amplitude, wave

velocity, direct wave amplitude and shape.

• Estimation of backscattering efficiency in granular media.

• Medium-size test boxes for loose materials.

160



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





• Scattering impulse reflectometry on cylindrical samples (core 10 cm

diameter).

• Ellipsometry (small, thin homogeneous layers of well determined

thickness of several mm).

Transmission lines and tubes etc.:

• Cylindrical coaxial cell with a vectorial network analyser from 0.05 to

1.6 GHz (material cores of 75 mm in diameter and 70 mm in height).

• TEM co-axial line for measurements of the complex permittivity of

hardened concrete in the frequency band 300 MHz - 900 MHz.

Samples have a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 10 cm.

Electromagnetic probes (capacimetry, TDR, methods based on resistivity

or induction):

• Percometer (permittivity, conductivity)

• Campbell probes CS615, CS616, CS650, HydraProbe (water content,

METHODS FOR NEAR-SURFACE ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES

DETERMINATION BY GPR (FIELD MEASUREMENTS)



The field methods of structural interpretations and assessment of

material properties apply the whole range of seismic data processing and

analysis. The main techniques for the determination of near-surface

permittivity and attenuation, are:

• Surface reflection amplitude in air-coupled systems.

• Velocity analysis using inter-layer reflections.

• Full-wave inversion for stratified media.

• Velocity analysis using CMP.

• Velocity analysis using WARR multi-offset configurations.

• Assessment of damping (CMP, scattering objects).

• Calculation of dispersion curves (either phase velocity or permittivity

vs. frequency).

• Normalised amplitude of direct wave and direct wave analysis in

ground-coupled systems.

161



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





• Velocity of direct and reflected waves.

• Attenuation assessment using deeper reflections or scattering.



To estimate the wave velocity, some auxiliary (calibration) methods are

being used:

• Drilling cores, trenches and outcrops.

• Local measurements carried out before and after laying the layers.

• Geodetic tests.



OTHER METHODS FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES ESTIMATION BY GPR

STUDIES (REAL CONSTRUCTIONS)



The methods described above are usually focused on the interpretation

of plenty of relatively easy available data and the expected precision is

large. Among the methods being used in real scenarios, the following

techniques can be mentioned:

• Forward or inverse modelling of intricate structure and permittivity

distribution.

• Hyperbola fitting (e.g. for positioning of reinforcement estimation,

sometimes with verification of electromagnetic signal velocity by

another methods), velocity analysis using numerous hyperbolic

anomalies, numerical hyperbola fitting (in development).

• Migration (especially when the depth of reinforcement is accurately

known).

• Backscattering; estimation of backscattering efficiency in granular

media and forward modelling of backscattering in granular media.

• Attenuation characterization by interpretation of the frequency

spectrum peaks shifting, (moisture content).

LABORATORIES & TEST SITES FOR MEASUREMENTS ON LARGE SAMPLES



The participants described in details some very interesting and

inspiriting solutions dedicated to experimental studies of methodologies

focused on material properties determination and on structural

problems (fig. 1).

• Collections of concrete slabs: 60x60x12cm of 6 different concrete

samples without reinforcement, walls containing reinforcement,

different thicknesses, slabs 70x90x13cm made of different concrete

mix with reinforcement or not, imbibed in pipe water or in sea water,

containing THR sensors at different depth.

162

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





• Field sites: pavement test sections with different pavement structures

(cement concrete, dense asphalt, porous asphalt, cobblestone) and

laboratory geotechnical testing field for experiments with soils and

different subbase layers (full scale tests) – the structure depends on

current experiment.

• Laboratory position for modelling of backscattering in granular

media: boxes containing materials to be compared with field tests

using GPR, seismic and resistivity methods.

CONCLUSIONS



There is a wide interest in volumetric water content determination by

using GPR. VWC assessment in pavement has proved to be the most

widespread application. Within pavement applications, major efforts are

devoted to the investigation of water content in asphalt layers.

Intermediate scale and large-scale VWC inspections are the most

common GPR inspection scales. From the available database, it is

expected to have at least one test site for half of the institution involved

in project 2.5 (13 out of 25).

“FDTD MODELLING OF THE GPR SIGNAL BASED ON DATA OBTAINED FROM

OTHER NDT METHODS: AN APPROACH FOR MORE EXHAUSTIVE

INTERPRETATION OF FIELD DATA”



Mercedes Solla (ES), Xavier Núñez-Nieto (ES)

merchisolla@uvigo.es



Abstract

GPR is a non-destructive (NDT) geophysical technology that shows many

applications in different fields, such as civil engineering, geology, forensics,

etc., where its implementation is becoming very important. In some cases,

the diffraction events produced by scattering make difficult the

interpretation of interesting reflectors. In this work, the FDTD modelling

was used to analyse the complex pattern of reflection obtained in order to

assist and to improve the interpretation of field GPR data for different

applications. More realistic models were built based on the data provided

by other NDT techniques, and the results have demonstrated its

capabilities to achieve more understanding of the radar wave propagation

phenomena and exhaustive interpretation.



1. INTRODUCTION

The analysis and interpretation of GPR data can be complicated since

many factors can adversely affect radar waves, including ringing noise,

diffraction events and reflection multiples. Numerical modelling has

become an interpretational tool that can be used to compare field GPR

data to synthetic data to understand the radar wave propagation

phenomena and to facilitate GPR data interpretation [1]. Many numerical

modelling methods are available for simulating the propagation of the

GPR waves in different media. However, when more sophisticated

interpretations are required, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)

technique has evolved into one of the most popular advanced modelling

tools [2]. This modelling method allows for the extraction of subtle

information from the field real data, such as diffraction patterns and the

presence of reflection multiples [3].

This work presents different study cases in which the capabilities of the

technique are demonstrated. Moreover, the approach here presented

includes the use of data provided by other NDT methods as inputs to

create large scale and more realistic models.

179



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





2. APPROACH FOR FDTD MODELLING

The method uses cubic cells (Yee cell) to create the computational

domain. Therefore, when structures of fine geometry need to be

modelled, the spatial resolution has to be very small in order to make a

reasonable staircase approximation of the curved interfaces [3]. This

approach results in excessive computer memory requirements and

subsequent increase in execution time. The latest GprMax version uses a

mixed model of parallelisation based on a hybrid MPI and OpenMP

programming, which allowed to assign the computation of different

traces to different nodes of a cluster.

A. SYNTHETIC MODELS

In the study cases here presented, the input to elaborate on the FDTD

modelling, was the data provided by complementary NDT methods, such

as the precise geometry (2D orthoimages) provided by laser scanning or

photogrammetric techniques. The purpose was to design realistic, large-

scale, synthetic GPR models to assist in the interpretation of the

processed field data. However, simulating large-scale and realistic

models requires high-performance computing to obtain results in a

reasonable time. Thus, the synthetic models were created using a

parallelized version of GprMax, which is an electromagnetic wave

simulator for GPR using the FDTD method [3]. The FDTD algorithm was

previously developed using the MATLAB programming language. The

synthetic models are built from the contour of the elements defined by

the orthoimages. For that purpose, the images had to be reprocessed

before they were introduced into the algorithm for FDTD modelling. This

operation consisted of classifying the materials presented in the image

according to the different hypotheses of simulation. As a result, an image

was obtained that was formed by different objects (defined by pure

colours). This approach encompasses the geometry of the model in fine

detail.'

B. SIMULATIONS

The synthetic models were built with a small spatial step (grid cell size in

the x- and y-directions), and the excitation was a Gaussian pulse of the

same centre frequencies used in field acquisition to get the best

approximation compared with the field data. The trace distance interval

and the total time were also defined in accordance with the real data.

After simulation, the synthetic data were exported and provided by

180



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





GprMax to ReflexW, and then filtered using a similar processing

sequence to that used for the field data.

For simulations, the electromagnetic properties to characterize the

propagation media were determined from the acquired field GPR data or

assumed from the typical values published in the literature.

3. STUDY CASES: RESULTS & DISCUSSION



This section presents different study cases in the application of the GPR

signal simulation, based on the use additional NDT techniques (such as

Photogrammetric or Laser scanning geometric techniques and

Thermography) for different field applications: heterogeneous masonry

structures, volcanic environments, as well as forensic and crime scene

investigations. The synthetic GPR data generated is compared with the

field GPR data acquired in order to improve the interpretation.

A. SIMULATIONS FOR MASONRY BRIDGE INSPECTIONS

Masonry bridges are built using heterogeneous filling that often

complicates the interpretation and analysis of field GPR data. FDTD

modelling of the GPR signal is therefore typically used as additional

interpretational tool. Some studies have included the use of

photogrammetry or laser scanning methods as a tool in the geometric

characterization of the structures for the elaboration of the simulated

models.

As shown in Fig. 1, the precise external geometry of the bridge

(orthoimage) provided by laser scanning (Fig. 1A) was used to create the

synthetic model (Fig. 1B). What is more, a heterogeneous medium was

simulated. This approach replicates the structure in fine detail and

allows reproducing the exact geometry. Apart from the reflections

generated from the arch-air interfaces (Fig. 1C:R1), subtle information

was interpreted such as the presence of reflection multiples produced

from the arch and because of the proximity between arches (Fig. 1C:R2

and R3, respectively). These reflection multiples were also observed in

the field GPR data (Fig. 1D:R2). All these complex reflections, if

unrecognized, can hinder the detection of other interesting reflectors. In

this frame, it was possible to identify, from the real data, the corner

reflections (Fig. 1D:R4) from the perpendicular interfaces between the

top of the vault and the water level (Fig. 1D:R3).

model, C) synthetic GPR data showing the reflections produced by the

arch-air interfaces (R1), reflection multiples from the arch (R2) as well as

the ones due to the proximity between arches (R3), and D) field GPR data

showing additional reflections such as the water level (R3) and the

corner reflections (R4). ( Data available from [4]).





Other interesting application of simulation in masonry bridges is the

most appropriate recognition of the complex pattern of reflections

produced by the arch-stone interface caused by the irregular shape of

the ring stones. Fig. 2 presents a synthetic model (Fig. 2A) constructed

from the contour of the arch ring defined by the orthoimages generated

from laser scanning data. Additionally, arch ring separation was

considered in the model in a portion of the arch at the right hand. This

simulation allows for the detection of inner structural damage such as

delamination and ring stone separation. In Fig. 2B, it is possible to

distinguish the hyperbolic reflection generated from the cavity simulated,

which could be directly compared to the field GPR data.

how arch-ring separation is identified by GPR. Left: synthetic model built

from an orthoimage provided by laser scanning, and right: synthetic data

obtained showing the reflection (circle area) produced by the cavity

simulated. ( Data available from [5]).





The final study case in masonry is to evaluate the potential of the GPR to

detect and analyse moisture content. A masonry bridge was inspected by

combining the techniques of GPR and infrared thermography. To assist

the GPR field data interpretation, FDTD was used. The model was

183





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





created from the orthothermograms (images obtained through the

orthogonal projection of each wall to a parallel plane, with no distortions

or perspective effect and with geometric information that enables them to

function as two-dimensional (2D) maps with thermographic texture)

provided by both photogrammetry and thermography (Fig. 3A). This way,

after an image pre-processing using MATLAB programming language

and considering a heterogeneous medium, a more accurate and

complete vision of the structure was obtained (Fig. 3B), and the detection

and analysis of moisture areas provide noteworthy information for

planning subsequent conservation actions. Observing the field data,

although the thermography (Fig. 3A) detected lower temperature over the

first arch (from 2 to 6 m) and the synthetic data (Fig. 3D) showed

attenuation at this portion of the bridge, the field GPR data did not

reveal attenuation of the signal at that position (Fig. 3C). The different

pattern of reflections that occurs over the first arch could be therefore an

indication of the existence of building materials different to the original

ones. Historical references were found, which inform a reconstruction of

this vault because of a great flood of water in 1984.

B. SIMULATIONS FOR VOLCANIC ENVIRONMENTS

To prevent collapse hazards in volcanic areas, exhaustive interpretation

of the GPR data, by using FDTD modelling, have demonstrated its

capabilities to detect lava tubes in the Timanfaya National Park (Spain).

The input geometry for synthetic models corresponded to the results

obtained from microgravity. (Fig. 4A) shows the gravity model created

using the field GPR data (Fig. 4B). Observing the synthetic GPR data

generated (Fig. 4C), several strong reflections are visible corresponding to

the roof, bottom and edges of the different lava tubes. Good correlation,

in location and geometry, was observed for lava tubes A, B and C.

Nevertheless, the tube D did not show good correspondence neither in

location nor geometry.

A possible explanation could be that the observed reflections are due to

heterogeneities in the internal structure of the lava flow and not really to

the small cavity deduced from the gravity model. Moreover, the

identification of a vertical dyke in the gravity data occurs at the same

position of the GPR reflections detected.



C. SIMULATIONS FOR FORENSIC AND CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATIONS

Reference [8] presents the use of FDTD modelling and GPR signal

characterization in forensics. Experimental scenes that mimic the most

frequent real forensic cases were built by considering several buried

objects: bone remains, clothes, active and inactive mobile phones, drug

caches, guns and bullet shells, etc. Additionally, the geometric

characterization of the scenes was made using photogrammetric

methods. The 3D models of the experimental grids were provided, and

the 2D sections obtained from these models were used as inputs in

creating the synthetic models. Both synthetic and field data were

compared to assist in the interpretation. As example, Fig. 5 shows the

experimental scene (2D orthoimage) (Fig. 5A) as well as the synthetic and

field data produced (Fig. 5 B and C, respectively) for the case of the

scene containing bone remains at 0.5 m depth. Although the field data

showed more complex reflections produced by the heterogeneous backfill

(Fig. 5C), the interpreted reflection patter produced by the bone remains

is very similar to that modelled in the synthetic radargram (Fig. 5B).

4. CONCLUSIONS

Realistic FDTD models can provide subtle information that can help with

field data interpretation. The data generated from other NDT allowed the

simulation of more realistic modelling scenarios using a mixed model of

parallelization. This approach encompasses the overall structures or

geometries in fine detail in a reasonable amount of time. In complex

scenarios, it can be difficult to obtain an accurate interpretation without

a comparison of the field data with the models.

This work was presented as a poster and concerned the electromagnetic

modelling of concrete structures, for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)

applications.

A set of scenarios was proposed by the authors, involving concrete cells

with various embedded objects. A detailed description of the cells and

the obtained FDTD [1] results are available for the Members of the COST

Action TU1208. The simplest cell includes circular-section bars of

different diameters, placed in concrete at increasing depths. Other cells

contain polyvinyl chloride ducts, steel objects commonly used in civil

engineering (as a pipe, an angle bar, a box section, and an u-channel),

voids and honeycombing defects. For each structure, a subset of models

with growing complexity is defined, starting from a simple representation

of the cell and ending with a more realistic one. In particular, the

model’s complexity increases from the geometrical point of view, as well

as in terms of how the constitutive parameters of the involved media and

GPR antennas are described.

The idea beyond this work is to start designing a new database that will

contain both numerical and experimental GPR responses from natural

and manmade structures. Researchers working on the development of

electromagnetic forward- and inverse-scattering techniques, imaging

methods and data-processing algorithms will thus have a further

opportunity of testing and validating, against reliable data, their

approaches.

The motivation to start this project came out during previous TU1208

meetings and takes inspiration by successful past initiatives carried out

in different areas, as the Ipswich [2-5] and Fresnel [6-9] databases in the

field of free-space electromagnetic scattering (collections of experimental

data measured on metallic and dielectric scatterers, in anechoic

chamber), and the Musumeci [24] database in seismic science (a dataset

1. INTRODUCTION



A continuous interest in the analysis of GPR systems and related

applications in civil engineering is observed. A deeper insight of

scattering phenomena in a lossy half-space, plus development of

sophisticated numerical methods based on FDTD method, FEM, BEM,

MoM and various hybrid methods, is required.



Generally, transient analysis of buried objects can be carried out in

either frequency domain (FD), or time domain (TD). The present work

deals with certain TD and FD analysis techniques for buried conducting

and dielectric objects. Both TD and FD approaches discussed

throughout this work and demonstrated on canonical geometries could

be useful for benchmark purpose.



TD analysis is related to the transient response of a horizontal thin wire

buried in a lossy half-space using a rigorous antenna theory (AT)

approach. The AT approach is based on the space-time integral equation

of the Pocklington type. The influence of the earth-air interface is taken

into account via the simplified reflection coefficient arising from the

Modified Image Theory (MIT).



Transient current induced along the wire due to the transmitted plane

wave excitation is compared in this work to the numerical results

calculated via TL approach and the AT approach based on the FD

variant of the Pocklington IDE. FD-IDE is numerically solved via the

Galerkin-Bubnov variant of the Indirect Boundary Element Method (GB-

IBEM) and the transient response is calculated via IFFT.



FD analysis is used to determine FD response of dielectric sphere using

the full wave model based on the set of coupled electric field integral

equations (EFIEs) for surfaces. Numerical solution is carried out by

means of an improved variant of the Method of Moments (MoM)

providing numerically stable and efficient procedure for the extraction of

singularities arising in integral expressions.

Some computational examples are now presented.



Wire arrays, with a two- or three-wire antenna array horizontally located,

are considered.



The excitation is a time-dependent Gaussian pulse voltage source. The

parameters of the Gaussian pulse are: V0=1V, g=2*109s-1 and t0=2ns, the

entire length of the wires is L=1 m, while the radius of all wires is

a=2mm. The array is located above half-space (εr =10).

The abstract is published in Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 16,

This work dealt with the wire-grid modelling of metallic cylindrical

objects, with a particular focus to GPR applications, and it was

presented as a poster.

Two-dimensional cylinders, with arbitrary section, were simulated

through a suitable set of perfectly-conducting wires; results were

obtained by using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique [1].

Wire-grid modelling of conducting objects was introduced by Richmond

in 1966 [2] and, since then, the method has been extensively used over

the years to simulate arbitrarily-shaped objects and compute radiation

patterns of antennas, as well as the electromagnetic field scattered by

targets. For any wire- grid model, a better accuracy can be achieved with

a larger number of wires; moreover, a fundamental question is the

choice of the optimum wire radius and grid spacing. The most widely

used criterion to fix the wire size is the so-called equal-area rule (EAR)

[3, 4]: the total surface area of the wires has to be equal to the surface

area of the object being modelled. This rule comes from empirical

observation and few authors have investigated its reliability for 2D

objects through the years [5, 6].

We analysed the reliability of the EAR, showing that it yields affordable

results but is quite far from being the optimum: higher accuracy can be

achieved by using a wire radius 12-15% shorter than what is suggested

by the rule. We considered circular- and square-section scatterers

embedded in a half-space, as well as objects partially buried in different

media of a multilayered structure or soil; the electromagnetic source was

always a line of current emitting an ultra-wide band pulse. Our results

are in good agreement with [5], where the wire-grid modelling of a

circular-section cylinder, buried in a half-space and illuminated by a

monochromatic plane wave, was studied.

235



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





We investigated as well the possibility to apply the wire-grid approach to

the simulation of buried slotted objects. In case of small slots, the wire-

grid results follow quite well the main reflections of the exact results, but

with some delay. More accurate results can be obtained for larger slots.

To model thick objects with large slots, it is recommended to use two

concentric arrays of wires, simulating both the inner and outer sections

of the scatterer.

The wire-grid approach can significantly enhance the versatility of those

electromagnetic methods which can deal only with scatterers having a

canonical shape of the cross-section, embedded in a homogeneous

material (e.g., the Cylindrical Wave Approach [7]). Outside from the

Ground Penetrating Radar field, our study may be useful for shielding

applications [8], and in the measurement of electromagnetic properties of

materials through the use of coaxial cages [9].

The wire-grid modelling of slotted objects, at the best of our knowledge,

hasn’t been studied by other authors and we plan to explore it more in

depth. Finally, we look forward to analysing the reliability of the same-

volume rule [10], for the modelling of dielectric two-dimensional objects

by small dielectric circular-section cylinders.

Abstract

The electromagnetic scattered field by a buried pipeline is calculated by

means of frequency-domain numerical simulations and by making use of

the scattered-field formulation. The pipeline, supposed to be used for water

conveyance, is modeled as a cylindrical shell made of poly-vinyl chloride

(PVC) material buried in a wall or pavement composed of cement with very

low losses and filled with water. In order to make the model simpler, the

pipeline is supposed running parallel to the air-cement interface. To excite

the model, a linearly-polarized plane wave impinging normally on the

above-mentioned interface is adopted. We consider two different

polarizations in order to determine the most useful in terms of scattered-

field sensitivity. Moreover, a preliminary frequency sweep allows us to

choose the most suitable operating frequency depending on the dimensions

of the pipeline cross-section. All the three components of the scattered field

are monitored along a line just above the interface.

The electromagnetic properties of the materials employed in this study are

present in the literature and, since a frequency-domain technique is

adopted, no further approximation is needed. Once the ideal problem has

been studied, we further complicate the model by introducing two fouling

scenarios due to limestone formation on the pipeline walls. In the first case,

the fouling is deposited at the bottom of the pipeline when the water

pressure is low enough and the second one considers the fouling to deposit

on the entire internal perimeter of the pipeline’s cross-section by forming an

additional limestone cylindrical layer. The results obtained in these cases

are compared with those of the initial problem with the goal of determining

the scattered field dependency on the fouling geometrical characteristics.

One of the practical applications in the field of Civil Engineering of this

study may be the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) techniques to

monitor the fouling conditions of water pipelines without the need to

intervene destructively in the structure.

1. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS



The first structure under consideration is a buried cylinder, with a cover

in PVC (PolyVinyl Chloride), filled by freshwater, with a layer, between

the water and the PVC cover, of limestone, see Fig. 1. From an

electromagnetic point of view, the problem can be studied as a multilayer

cylinder buried in a half-space.





Figure 1: Geometry of the problem with concentric cylinders.

We consider an electromagnetic plane wave, coming from air, impinging

on the interface with a cement, having a relative permittivity εC = 5.24.

Inside the cement, at a distance h = 250.0 mm, is a cylinder of radius a

= 125.0 mm, composed of three layers. The external layer, of thickness

aPVC = 14.8 mm, is filled by PVC, with electromagnetic relative

permittivity εPVC = 3.10. The second layer, of thickness aL, is filled by

limestone, with electromagnetic relative permittivity εL = 8.01 and electric

conductivity σL = 0.10 S/m. We consider different thickness of the

limestone, between 0.0 mm, and 36.8 mm, in order to understand the

behavior of the electromagnetic interaction as a function of this

parameter. Finally, the last layer, i.e., the core of the cylinder, is filled by

freshwater, with electromagnetic relative permittivity εW = 81.00 and

electric conductivity σW = 0.01 S/m. The frequency range under

consideration is f = 10.0 ÷120.0 MHz. We suppose that the relative

permittivity and the electric conductivity do not change in the frequency

range, i.e., we consider non dispersive materials. It is important to note

239



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





that, while the conductivity of the media does not change with the

frequency, the wave attenuation does. In fact, as it is well known, the

attenuation is related to the conductivity, but it is also proportional to

the frequency.

The principal aim of this investigation is to understand how the

electromagnetic scattering by this cylinder is affected by the presence of

the limestone layer, in order to find some indications on the crucial

parameters to take into account for the detection of the limestone

residues in a water tube. To implement this analysis, we consider a

decomposition of the electromagnetic field. Each field will be taken into

account as the superposition of two different polarizations, in order to

consider the general case of circular polarization. We refer to each

polarization with a scalar function V, that would represents the electric

or the magnetic field parallel to the cylinder’s axis, depending on the

polarization. We consider an electromagnetic plane wave, coming from

the air, Vi, this field is transmitted in the cement half-space, where we

find a second plane wave Vt, obtained from the incident one by the

multiplication times the Fresnel coefficient of the relevant polarization.

This field interacts with the cylinder, generating the scattered field Vs,

and penetrating inside the cylinder, generating the field Vc. The scattered

field interacts with the interface, generating other two fields: the

scattered-reflected field and the scattered-transmitted field, Vsr and Vst,

respectively [1-5]. Moreover, the internal field to the cylinder, can be

decomposed in three different fields, one in the PVC, one in the

limestone and the final one in the freshwater. To solve the

electromagnetic scattering problem, we have to expand all the fields in

cylindrical harmonics, in order to impose the boundary conditions on

each layer of the cylinder. This procedure bring us to define a linear

system which solution gives all the unknown coefficients of the

cylindrical harmonic expansions. At this point we are able to calculate

the scattered-transmitted field, which is the field that a receiver

measures outside the cement layer.

After the analysis of the multilayer cylinder, we study another interesting

case. We consider a PVC cylinder filled by water, where the limestone

stratification is only on the bottom part of the pipeline, see Fig. 2. This

case of study is to represent that the limestone usually settling only in

the bottom part of the pipeline. From an electromagnetic point of view,

we can consider the limestone deposition as an eccentric cylinder, with

the center at a small distance below the center of the principal cylinder.

240





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





The problem of the scattering by two or more eccentric cylinders has

been widely discussed in the literature, and it can be faced by mean of

different numerical techniques [6-8]. The field decomposition outside the

external cylinder is the same of the previous case. Inside the cylinders,

the fields in the PVC layers and in the water core must be decomposed

in cylindrical harmonics centered in the reference frame of the eccentric

limestone cylinder, in order to apply the boundary conditions on its

surface. In the same way, the field in the limestone layer must be

decomposed in cylindrical harmonics centered in the reference frame of

the external cylinder, in order to apply the boundary conditions on the

external surface.





Figure 2: Geometry of the problem with eccentric cylinders.



2. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The first result that we show is related to the case of the PVC pipeline

with a freshwater core and without the limestone layer. This case can be

taken into account by considering aL = 0.0 mm. We consider the plane

wave at normal incidence, along the x-axis. Therefore, the x-component

of the electric field will be zero for both the polarizations. The cylinder

axis coincides with the z-axis. In Fig. 3, the amplitude of the scattered-

241





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





transmitted field on the interface, for both the polarizations, is shown, in

the whole frequency range. It can be seen that the E-polarization

backscattering grows in frequency, while the H-polarization is almost

constant and start to grow in the last part of the frequency range. The

most interesting frequency is around f = 100.0 MHz, where, the E-

polarization presents a maximum, and the H-polarization presents a

minimum.

At this point, we consider this value of the frequency and analyze the

scattering by the cylinder for different thickness of the limestone layer,

in the hypothesis of concentric cylinders. In Fig. 4, we can see the

amplitude of the electric field, for both the polarizations. The two

polarizations respond in two opposite ways to the growing of the

limestone thickness. The backscattering in E-polarization decrease by

increasing aL, while the backscattering in H-polarization increase by

increasing the limestone thickness.

polarizations in the whole frequency range.

Figure 4: Amplitude of the electric field components as a function of the

limestone thickness, in the hypothesis of concentric layers.



We can find a simple physical explanation to these two opposite

behaviors. In E-polarization, the electric field, being parallel to the

cylinder axis, is principally affected by the freshwater content, due to the

high permittivity of the water. When the limestone layer grows in

thickness, the quantity of the water decrease, and as a consequence also

the backscattering for this polarization decreases. On the other hand, in

H-polarization, the electric field is on the plane of the cylinder section.

Therefore, the backscattering is driven by the capacitance effects. The

effective capacitance of the cylinder section grows by increasing the

limestone thickness and, as a consequence, also the backscattering

increases.

In Fig. 5, we consider the case of a limestone settling. We can see that

the electric fields response is approximately the same of Fig. 4.

Therefore, the hypothesis of a uniform deposition is a good

approximation of the case of the deposition in the bottom part of the

pipeline.

This behavior of the two polarizations suggests to consider as an index of

the limestone thickness, the ratio between the backscattered field

magnitudes in the two polarizations: ! = |!!|/|!!|. This parameter grows

with the limestone thickness in both the case of a homogeneous

deposition of the limestone around the inner surface of the PVC cover,

see Fig. 6, and in the case of a deposition of the limestone on the bottom

part of the pipeline, see Fig. 7. By knowing the tube transverse

dimension and its orientation, it is possible to derive the standard value

of the e coefficient. Measuring the backscattering field in both

polarizations, it is possible to compare the value of the parameter e in

order to obtain an estimation of the limestone thickness. This result is

important because we are considering a thickness many times smaller

than the wavelength.

3. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper, we analyzed the scattering of a plane wave by a

buried circular pipeline made by a PVC cover and a freshwater core. In

this study, we considered the presence of a limestone layer between the

water and the PVC. We performed a frequency sweep in order to find the

frequency for which the ratio between the responses to the two different

polarizations was maximum. At this particular frequency, we considered

the backscattering magnitudes as functions of the limestone thickness

in two cases: a homogeneous layer of limestone all around the inner

surface of the PVC cover, and a settling of the limestone on the bottom of

the pipeline. In both cases, we found an opposite behavior of the

responses of the two polarizations: when the electric field is parallel to

the cylinder axis, the backscattering decreases with the limestone

thickness, while, when the magnetic field is parallel to the cylinder axis,

the backscattering increases with such thickness. From these results,

we proposed the ratio between the magnitudes of the backscattering in

the two polarizations as an index to obtain the limestone thickness in

the pipeline. Future works will consider an investigation on the index

behavior at different frequencies and its validation for other kinds of

materials.

1. INTRODUCTION

Ground penetrating radars (GPRs) are key instruments for subsurface

monitoring and imaging. Further research is however needed for facing

the complexity of the underlying inverse scattering imaging problem

(non-linearity and ill-posedness). A novel integrated electromagnetic

inverse scattering strategy is proposed, using an iterative multi-scaling

approach for focusing the reconstruction only on limited subdomains of

the original investigation region, and using an efficient inexact-Newton

method within the second-order Born approximation for the

regularization of the inverse problem. The approach is validated by

means of numerical simulations.

The imaging of walls, roads, pavements and buildings using Ground

Penetrating Radar (GPR) measurements represents a very active topic

within the activities of the ELEDIA Research Center (DISI - University of

Trento, Italy). More in details, the research activities mainly focus on the

exploitation of advanced inverse scattering techniques, both

deterministic and stochastic, together with their integration with multi-

resolution methods, for the processing of GPR data. The performances of

such inversion strategies have been well assessed when dealing with

free-space microwave imaging scenarios, while multi-resolution

approaches proved to be very effective in mitigating issues such as the

non-linearity and ill-posedness of the inverse problem, which turn out to

be even more remarkable when dealing with the more complex GPR

formulation. In particular, great efforts have been devoted towards the

development of a regularized multi-resolution approach based on the

Inexact Newton (IN) method, both under the Second Order Born

Approximation (SOBA) [1] and exploiting the full non-linear formulation

of the GPR microwave imaging problem [2]. Moreover, the use of multi-

frequency strategies is currently under investigation. These approaches

allow to extract and then exploit the information coming from the

intrinsic frequency diversity of the collected GPR data. In this

framework, a multi-resolution technique based on a Frequency Hopping

(FH) approach has been presented in [3] and [4]. Particular attention is

also devoted towards the development of innovative imaging approaches

based on Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS), which can be profitably

exploited for the retrieval of multiple scatterers which are sparse with

respect to a properly chosen representation basis [5],[6]. Furthermore,

imaging approaches based on the level-set-based optimization technique

have been considered, as well, for the qualitative reconstruction of

multiple and disconnected homogeneous scatterers [7]. Finally, the real-

time detection, localization and classification of defects embedded within

inaccessible domains has been investigated by exploiting the so-called

Learning-By-Examples (LBE) paradigm [7].

PROGRESS REPORT OF PROJECT 3.5



“DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED GPR DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES”

Abstract



Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive geophysical method

that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. Notwithstanding it is

particularly promising for soil characteristics interpretation, GPR is

characterized by a notoriously difficult automated data analysis. Hence,

this contribution reports the works published during the first year of the

COST action TU1208, as well as the future directions and the on-going

researches in the field of GPR data processing techniques.



1. INTRODUCTION



The Project 3.5 of the COST action TU1208 is titled “Development of

advanced GPR data processing techniques”, and comprises 44

participants (included the 2 co-leaders) originating from 14 different

Countries. In particular, participants come from (in alphabetic order):

Armenia, Belgium, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Norway,

Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, The Netherlands, Turkey, and UK. The

focus of Project 3.5 is particularly devoted to the development of GPR

data processing techniques, studying and proposing signal processing

methods for the enhancement of the GPR signal such as: denoising,

deconvolution, migration and attribute analysis as well as visualization

of GPR data.

This report is organized as follows. In the next Section, we review the

papers published by the 3.5 participants during the first year of the

Action. Then, we outline the on-going researches, briefly discussing what

more is needed and what is expected during the next years.

2. RELATED WORKS



In the field of civil engineering, sounding the pavement layers is

classically performed using standard ground penetrating radar, whose

vertical resolution is bandwidth dependent. The layer thicknesses are

deduced from both the time delays of backscattered echoes and the

298



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





permittivity of layers. In contrast with conventional spectral analysis

approaches, the work in [1] focuses on one of the machine learning

algorithms, namely, the support vector machine, to perform time delay

estimation and dielectric constant estimation of the medium from

backscattered radar signals. The authors show the super time resolution

capability of such technique to resolve overlapping and fully correlated

echoes within the context of thin pavement layer testing. Then, in civil

engineering, ground penetrating radar is widely used for road pavement

surveys. In contrast to the existing literature, in [2] the influence of

interface roughness (surface and interlayer roughness of stratified

media) is accounted for within the scope of the data processing of radar

signals. The rigorous electromagnetic method PILE (propagation inside

layer expansion) provides the simulated data. The observed frequency

variations of the radar magnitude introduce some shape distortion on

the radar wavelet. An adaptation of the root-MUSIC algorithm is

proposed on the basis of the work. As a result, it is allowed to jointly

estimate the time delay and the interface roughness.

Now let us talk of inverse scattering and imaging by presenting some

recent advances in this fields. In [3], the reconstruction of shallow buried

object is addressed by an electromagnetic inverse scattering method

based on combining different imaging modalities. In particular, the

proposed approach integrates the inexact-Newton method with an

iterative multi-scaling approach. Moreover, the use of the second-order

Born approximation is exploited. A numerical validation is provided

concerning the potentialities arising by combining the regularization

capabilities of the inexact-Newton method and the effectiveness of the

multi-focusing strategy to mitigate the non-linearity and ill-posedness of

the inversion problem. Comparisons with the standard "bare" approach

in terms of accuracy, robustness, noise levels, and computational

efficiency are also included. In addition, in [4], a GPR survey through a

multi-resolution deterministic approach is carried out (inverse scattering

and imaging). In [5], a novel electromagnetic inverse scattering method is

proposed for the reconstruction of shallow buried objects. The inversion

procedure is based on the combination of different imaging modalities. In

particular, an iterative multi-scaling approach is adopted for focusing

the reconstruction only on limited subdomains of the original

investigation region. The data inversion is performed by applying an

inexact-Newton method (which exhibits very good regularization

properties) within the second-order Born approximation. The use of this

approximation allows a reduction of the problem unknowns and a

mitigation of the nonlinear effects. The proposed approach has been

299



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





validated by means of several numerical simulations. In particular, the

reconstruction performances have been evaluated in terms of accuracy,

robustness, noise levels, and computational efficiency, with particular

emphasis on the comparisons with the results obtained by using the

standard “bare” approach. Finally, in [6], the inspection of 2-D scatterers

buried in a lossy half-space from field measurements is formulated

within the framework of the second-order Born approximation (SOBA) of

the inverse scattering problem. An iterative multi-scaling approach

(IMSA) is combined with a two-step inexact-Newton algorithm to solve

the arising problem. A set of preliminary numerical results is presented

to assess the features and potentialities of the considered approach also

in comparison with state of the art inexact-Newton-SOBA techniques.

However, probing the near-subsurface in presence of absorbing media is

a very challenging problem. Within that framework, the authors of [7]

analyze the capabilities of a mono-frequency/multistatic set-up for

detecting shallowly buried targets. As the antennas constitute an

important part of the probing device, an accurate method for modelling

the antennas behaviour is proposed. This modelling, performed thanks

to a correctly balanced set of elementary sources, is then incorporated in

the calculation of the scattered field, performed with a home-made Finite

Element Method software. The measured multistatic fields serve as input

data for the inversion algorithm, an extension of the DORT method to

elongated targets [8]. This qualitative and fast imaging procedure allows

to obtain imaging results of shallowly buried targets embedded in a

highlosses medium [9].Now, let us have a deep look of what has been

done in terms of GPR signal processing techinques. In [10], the authors

relate the shift of the frequency peak of the Ground Penetrating Radar

(GPR) spectrum with the increasing of the moisture content in the soil.

The weakness characterizing this approach is represented by the needs

of high resolution signals, whereas GPR spectra are affected by low

resolution. The novelty introduced by this work is twofold. First, they

evidence that clay content information is present in the location where

the maximum amplitude of the GPR spectra occurs. Then, they analyze

three super resolution methods, namely parabolic, triangular, and sinc-

based interpolators, to further refine the location of the frequency peak.

In fact, it is really important to be able to find this location quite

precisely, to obtain accurate estimates of clay content. They show that

the peak location can be found best through sinc-interpolation in the

frequency domain of the measured data. Experimental results confirm

the effectiveness of the proposed approach to resolve a frequency shift in

the GPR spectrum, even for a small amount of clay. Then, the focus of

300

the work in [11] is to provide the reader with a deep understanding of

the state of the art and open issues in the field of GPR data processing

techniques as well as of the interesting application of GPR in the field of

civil engineering. In particular, the authors present an overview on noise

suppression, deconvolution, migration, attribute analysis and

classification techniques for GPR data. In [12], the needs for advanced

sensing technologies in the field of civil engineering are shown and

discussed. In the first part of the work, the authors present an overview

of these main needs, fields by fields, from the constructions and

inspections of the transportation infrastructures and the hydraulic

works, to the geotechnical surveys and environmental monitoring as well

as the buildings and bridge structural assessments. In the second part,

they discuss the upgrading and evolution of the sensing technologies,

oriented to the civil engineering applications. They demonstrate why the

Ground Penetrating/Probing Radar is currently considered as one of the

most effective and efficient sensing technology and potentially candidate

to become the best available remote sensing technology for civil

engineering applications. Finally, in [13], an innovative application for

mobile platforms (smartphones and tablets) for real-time GPR data

processing. This work aims at providing a useful support for engineers

and technicians as well, for road and pavement inspection. According to

the presented results, this application can play an important role for all

the agencies involved in roads and highway management. In particular,

it will provide strategic and innovative potentialities, by improving the

onsite efficiency and effectiveness of the works.



3. ON-GOING RESEARCHES



GPR proves to be very useful in road monitoring applications, pipes,

cables, tunnels and other buried objects delineation, railways ballast

condition monitoring, concrete structures inspection and bridge deck

inspection, buried archaeological ruins mapping, and many other

relevant applications which have already been applied or are to come in

the future. In [14], an interesting review of the GPR technologies and

methodologies used in Italy is carried out. Then, the research centers

belonging to the Project 3.5 of the COST Action TU1208 are actually

investigating numerous topics in the field of GPR data processing

techniques related to the aforementioned applications. For example,

currently, subsurface imaging from GPR measurements represents a

very active topic within the activities of the ELEDIA Research Center

(DISI - University of Trento, Italy) [15]. More in details, the research

301

activities mainly focus on the exploitation of advanced inverse scattering

techniques, whose performances have been well assessed in case of

freespace scenarios, and their integration with multi-scaling methods for

the processing of GPR data. Moreover, great efforts are devoted to the

development of inversion strategies that can profitably exploit the

frequency diversity of GPR measurements, in order to improve the

quality of the retrieved dielectric profiles, both qualitatively and

quantitatively. Particular attention is also devoted to the extension of

innovative imaging approaches based on Bayesian Compressive Sensing

(BCS) and Interval Analysis (IA) to the problem of subsurface

prospecting, as well as to the exploitation of Learning-By-Example (LBE)

algorithms for enabling real-time detection and classification of buried

objects. The on-going researches of the Université catholique de Louvain

linked to the topics of the WP are the following: ( i) Information content in

frequency-dependent and multi-offset GPR data for layered media

reconstruction; ( ii) Image resolution improvement using GPR data fusion;

( iii) Effective physically- and mathematically-based detection of

hyperbola and determination of the dielectric permittivity in complex

field radar data; and ( iv) deconvolution. Other activities related to the

COST action carried out at University of Nantes and CEREMA, Les Ponts

de Cé, France are: ( i) Estimation of time delays, permittivities and

roughness parameters by GPR, especially with subspace methods

(MUSIC, ESPRIT, etc); and ( ii) Detection of debonding within pavement

structures by GPR with machine learning methods. Then, at the Applied

Geophysics Lab., School of Mineral Resources Engineering, Technical

Univerity of Crete, these are the on-going researches: ( i) automatic

bandpass filtering and deconvolution of GPR data; ( ii) attenuation

analysis of GPR data; and ( iii) noise suppression of GPR data using the

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method.



4. CONCLUSIONS



This paper has presented a review of what has been done during the first

year of the COST action TU1208 in the field of GPR data processing

techniques by the WG 3.5 participants. Fundamental topics such as

denoising, deconvolution, migration, attribute analysis, inverse

scattering and imaging were discussed as well as the on-going studies.

Notwithstanding this research area has already been well studied by

many researchers as well evidenced by the works presented in the

reference’s Section, more is needed and even more is expected from

automatic GPR data analysis in the next years.

The number of observables was decreased by taking into account the

quality index, the relevance index (linked to the correlation quality), as

well as some practical considerations (portability of the technique,

duration, expertise of the members of the project, feedback from the

experience on-site).

18 observables were selected, 6 of which were considered more relevant:

- ultrasonic surface wave velocity

- ultrasonic longitudinal wave velocity

- resistivity quadripole

- resistivity Wenner

- amplitude of radar direct wave

- velocity of radar direct wave

CONCLUSIONS

-

Combination of techniques is necessary for a reliable evaluation of

concrete properties.

-

Moisture is a permanent influent factor so electromagnetic

methods are fully relevant in this context.

-

By analysing the variability of ND measurements we have

proposed a possible way for discriminating the most reliable NDT

methods regarding each concrete property assessment.

-

We proposed to use a procedure of data fusion for enhancing the

quality of the combination which must be calibrated by

destructive testing.

-

The perspectives of current projects are for decreasing the

number of cores for destructive evaluation and for optimising

their location on the structures.

-

Challenges are also for the ND evaluation of new concrete

properties.

ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY (ERT)

Using the composite information such as geometry and resistivity, a view

from below gives an idea on the subsurface setup. Yellow and red zones

are human constructions „floating“ in one very clayey geological

environment.





SEISMIC: MASW (MULTICHANNEL ANALYSIS OF SURFACE WAVES)

In an effort to quantify the effect of the vibrations due to the heavy road

traffic, one additional geophysical study on earth dynamics was carried

out. The first step to this direction was to establish a microzonation

study of the subsurface of Tomb is performed. The digital seismograph

DAQLINK III of GEOSERVICE was used. As seismic source, the ambient

road traffic was used. Passive seismics (MASW) were applied, with 24

geophones in a circular array.

Phase-velocity vs frequency diagram and shear wave velocity (Poisson‘s

ratio) calculation are reported in the following. From the diagrams it is

concluded that the average Vs is 270 m/sec for a confidence depth ot 44

m. It is obvious that the Tomb will never suffer from earthquakes!

EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

CONCLUSIONS

1) An anomaly was detected at the entrance to the tomb, at 20 cm depth.

2) Two interfaces were detected, at 25 and 50 cm depth (stone-stone and

stone-natural soil interfaces).

3) Local fissures were detected, at different levels.

4) High signal attenuation may be associated to high salt content.

5) An anomaly was present in several radargrams and probably indicates

the presence of a wall.

6) The apex of the tomb was detected at 1 m depth, according to the

Biers model (1980).

7) The integration of GPR and ERT allowed locating voids and confirming

high salt content. The passive seismic analysis confirmed the presence of

a non-rocky soil.

Old Bridge – Aylesford, Kent, UK



1. BACKGROUND

The Old Bridge at Aylesford dates from around 1250. The bridge is made

of local “Ragstone”. It underwent a major alteration in 1811. The bridge

is closed to cars and motorbikes but remains in use for pedestrians,

cyclists and horses. There is currently no lighting system on the bridge.

Aylesford Parish Council plans to install spotlights flush within the

upper layer of the bridge deck.

334



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





The bridge is a scheduled ancient monument and listed building and so

is firmly under the control of English Heritage. English Heritage would

consider a proposal for the installation of a lighting system on the

bridge, provided the lights and power cables could be installed within

the upper layer of the modern asphalt without any intrusion on to the

historic stonework of the bridge.



Objectives

Perform a high frequency GPR survey (2GHz) of the asphalt surface of

the Old Bridge, Aylesford to determine the following parameters:

% The thickness of the upper asphalt layer.

% The total depth from the bridge surface to the historic stonework.

% The uniformity of the upper asphalt layer and total depth.



Action

A preliminary reconnaissance visit was made to the bridge in December

2012.

A full high frequency radar survey of the bridge was performed on 15

January 2013, and repeated on 12 September 2013. During the visit on

12 September 2013 the team also acquired a low frequency GPR survey.

On 26 September 2013 the team acquired a full 3D Laser Scanner point

cloud image of the bridge.



2. SURVEY METHOD 1 – 2 GHZ ANTENNA

The data was acquired using a modified IDS RIS Hi-BrigHT Ground

Penetrating Radar (GPR) system consisting of eight horizontally polarised

2GHz channels with 10 cm spacing; this gives each scan or ‘swathe’ a

footprint 80 cm wide.

335





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





The bridge deck was surveyed using four scans spaced equally,

performed along the length of the bridge providing full coverage with

approximately 10 cm spacing.



To break the data into more manageable areas, the survey was broken

into three ‘Zones’.

The following diagram shows the area covered by the four data swathes,

each swathe consisting of eight scans.



It is possible to represent each channel of the radar data as a ‘B-Scan’ (a

vertical cross-section slice), or to represent the B-Scans side by side and

cut them from above in a ‘C-Scan’ view. The C-Scan is helpful to

represent certain features as it gives a plan view of the bridge at a given

‘cut’ depth.

The following B-Scan view shows two traffic light sensors on the bridge.



The quantity of data acquired was far greater than was required for

identification of bridge deck layers. In the following depictions, layers

can be clearly seen on the

336

The depth of each layer was exported to Excel in 0.5 m increments, as

represented in the table below. Next, the maximum, minimum and

average figures (m) for two identified layers for Zone 1 are presented, as

well as the distribution of the layers measurements in Zone 1.

3. SURVEY METHOD 2 - EXPLORING THE BRIDGE DECK USING DUAL

FREQUENCY 200MHZ AND 600MHZ ANTENNA FROM THE RIS HI MOD

To possibly identify the location of the reinforcement bars / structural

ties & To investigate the influence of frequency change on bridge deck

structural detail, four scans were performed using the TR Dual-F

200MHz and 600MHz antenna from the RIS Hi Mod. The existing

reference points (high frequency survey) were exploited. The above-

mentioned antenna box contains an array of two antennas with

frequencies optimised for the detection of utilities. In typical ground

conditions, the 600MHz antenna should penetrate to approximately

1.5m and the 200MHz to approximately 2.5m, which should be sufficient

to identify the reinforcing bars passing through the bridge.

Examples of B-Scans radar data identifying the presence of reinforcing

bars, are shown (one example per each frequency).

Marc Van Meirvenne (BE) - marc.vanmeirvenne@ugent.be



PARTICIPANTS (18 ! 37)

At Rome meeting (July 2013): appointment of leader; no report.

No report at Nantes meeting.

ACTIONS:

1.!Establishment of participant list

2. Questionnaire prior to EGU2014





1. WHICH, OTHER THAN GPR, ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC METHODS

DO YOU USE FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS

(INCLUDING SOIL)?



• EMI: EM31, EM34, EM38, EM61, Dualem1, Dualem12, Dualem421

• ERT: electrical resistivity tomography, sounding and profiling,

CVES/IP (Circular Vertical Electrical Sounding/Induced Polarization

with multi electrode arrays)

• Transient EM (helicopter)

• MRS (Magnetic Resonance Sounding: hydraulic permeability and

porosity)

• Borehole logging : electrical-, EM-, radioactive-probes, CS616,

CS650, HydraProbe

• TDR (time domain reflectometry)

Other non-E or -EM methods mentioned:

• Magnetometry

• Seismic (refraction seismic, surface wave seismic and high resolution,

reflection seismic)

• seismic, video and acoustic probes

Other E or EM methods not mentioned:

- gamma ray

- vis-NIR spectrometry



375



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





2. FOR WHICH PURPOSE DO YOU USE THESE METHODS ?

• Soil characterization over large scales (agriculture, environmental

management..)

• Soil Volumetric Water Content, hydraulic conductivity

• Porosity, compaction

• Frost, snow

• Soil deformation

• For ground investigation for infrastructure work. It can be early in

the site investigation to map at a larger geological scale or in the

detailed geotechnical investigation to map with high resolution or to

solve specific geotechnical problems.

• To map aquifers or aquifer protection

• Utility and UXO (on-shore and off-shore)

• Archaeological prospection

• Waste detection and characterization (Landfill Mining)

3. DO YOU COMBINE OR INTEGRATE THE RESULTS OF THESE METHODS WITH

GPR MEASUREMENTS, OR DO YOU USE EACH METHOD INDEPENDENTLY?

PLEASE EXPLAIN FURTHER.

• EMI data and GPR data are jointly interpreted whenever possible, but

not quantitatively merged.

• ERT is used to calibrate the EMI data and to obtain quantitative EMI

data at large scales and to invert for layered subsurface

conductivities.

• We combine the data when possible, e.g. electrical conductivity

results of surface GPR full-waveform inversion are successfully

combined with EMI and ERT.

• We use TDR measurements to validate GPR measurements.

• Normally we do independent geophysical interpretation first, followed

by integrated geological interpretation. If we have boreholes we use

these in the integrated interpretation.

• EM31 -38 are used mainly in soil studies to get the EC profile of soil.

4. IF YOU DO NOT USE ANY OTHER METHOD BESIDES GPR, DO YOU INTENT TO

EXPAND YOUR ACTIONS INTO ANOTHER E OR EM METHOD IN THE NEAR

FUTURE (I.E. WITHIN THE TIME WINDOW OF THE COST ACTION) ? IF SO,

WHICH METHOD DO YOU INTEND TO ACQUIRE ?

No reactions.

376



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





5. ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU WANT TO PROVIDE IN THE FRAME OF THIS

PROJECT (LIKE WHY YOU JOINED THIS PROJECT)?

• "For characterizing soil, or identifying subsurface features, GPR alone

is not sufficient at all. Other sensors need to be taken in account, but

merging these datasets is a big challenge."

• "Recent improvements of EMI equipment and the development of

quantitative multi-layer inversion software enables the lateral and

vertical characterization of the subsurface over large scales. Until

now most of these developments are used for soil characterization, I

see huge opportunities of this method in the civil-engineering area."

• "We joined this project to gain knowledge on GPR, especially on 3D-

radar systems that we recently started to use. We also want to share

the experience we have with our integrated use of many methods.

Based on our marine work we also use advanced solutions for

positioning, navigation and not least for efficient reporting and here

we also feel that we can share some experience."

• "I know that GPR is good method to find out moisture changes in

media, but it is poor to classify changes in conductivity. There are

better methods for conductivity classification. I know the probes for

monitoring purposes and some EM methods, but I am sure there are

new better ways as well. "

CONCLUSION OF QUESTIONNAIRE

• Several E- and EM-methods are used besides GPR, mainly EMI

and ERT.

• Wide range of applications: from soil and infrastructure

characterization to utility and UXO detection).

• GPR and the other methods are mostly integrated or combined in

some way, but full quantitative fusion remains a challenge.

• Members expect two-way interactions: share expertise and learn

about new approaches.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE

• Relaunch questionnaire with more directed questions to P4.5.

• List more extensively available methods, application fields,

expectations and expertises.

• Disseminate results among all COST TU1208 to facilitate

interactions and collaborations.

CONCLUSIONS



Both EMI and GPR allow to produce detailled subsurface images. Their

combination gives a good representation of the general organisation of

the soil and allows the detection, identification and localisation of

different types of subsurface features. Although ground truthing

remains required for anambiguous interpretation, EMI + GPR represent

a powerful combination for industrial site characterisation.

“A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE ROCK SPREADING, ROCK

SLIDING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE SITES ON THE MALTESE ARCHIPELAGO”



Sebastiano D’Amico (IT)

sebdamico@gmail.com



ABSTRACT



Landslides are widespread along the north-western coast of the Island of

Malta and are strictly linked to the structural setting. Lateral spreading

phenomena and rockfalls are due to Limestones overlying a clayey

formation, representing the shallower lithotypes that characterize the

superficial layer. In this study we propose a a multidisciplinary and

multitechnical approach in order to investigate the kinematics and the

evolution of these types of coastal landslides.



1. INTRODUCTION



The Maltese Archipelago is situated in the Mediterranean Sea, about 290

km northeast of Tunisia and 90 km south of Sicily. It consists of three

major islands: Malta, Gozo, and Comino, which lies in the Comino

Straits separating the two largest islands. The Maltese economy is

mainly based on the tourism industry with a high degree of coastal

urban settlements. In order to better preserve the historical heritage,

landscapes, and coastal areas and to promote tourism activities, it has

been proposed that the archipelago might be considered as an open air

laboratory. In this context multidisciplinary studies integrating geology,

engineering, geomorphology as well as history and archeology may be

undertaken in order to develop and test methodologies for the

assessment of the relationship between the physical environment and

cultural heritage sites. In this study we propose a a multidisciplinary

and multitechnical approach in order to investigate the kinematics and

the evolution of coastal landslides and the conservation of historical

sites.



2. METHOD



In Fig. 1 is reported an example of typical situation of lateral spreading

and rock fall on the Maltese archipelago. In order to investigate the mass

movement and the influence of the fractures in the Upper Coralline

390





EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





Limestone (UCL) formation we recorded ambient noise time series at

several locations using a portable 3-component seismograph. The time

series are processed to give both horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio

graphs (H/V) as well as frequency-dependent polarisation analysis.

.





FIG. 1− a) Location of the test sites in the Maltese Archipelago (colours

edge of the cliff, illustrating vertical displacements of Blocks B and C, and

approximate positions of measurement sites 22, 10 and 19. The

approximate transect is shown on the inset map. This is a typical situation

of lateral spreading and rock fall on the Maltese archipelago. c) d) e).

Fractures at the selected sites. It is evident that the fractures are effecting

historical sites as well as modern urban areas.



The H/V graphs illustrate and quantify aspects of site resonance effects

due both to underlying geology as well as to mechanical resonance of

partly or wholly detached blocks [1]. The polarization diagrams indicate

predominant directions of vibrational effects. Results from this study

show an unambiguous distinction between the behaviour of the inland

plateau areas, away from the cliff edges, the region of the unstable cliff

391



EU Cooperation in Science and Technology ̶ Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”





edge and the actual rockfall areas. However, it has not be possible to

evaluate the extension of the fractures and the depth they reach. This is

the reason why we propose the use of other engineering techniques such

as Ground Penetrating radar which can help to identify buried

structures as well as have a measurements of the extention of potentially

hazardous fractures presents in area of high density buildings and/or

historical monuments.



3. CONCLUSION



Ambient vibration time series have been shown to contain information

that is relevant to the behaviour of coastal features at different stages of

destabilisation. Using polarisation analysis, it has been possible to

distinguish unambiguously between H/V peaks that arise from

resonances in the shallow crustal layering, including low-velocity layers

in this particular case, and peaks that arise from whole-block

mechanical vibrational modes. Where blocks are only partly detached

from the mainland, and are limited in their degrees of freedom, the

dominant direction of polarization is generally normal to the cliff edge, or

to the large scale fractures. Where blocks are fully detached, the

polarization directions appear to indicate the existence of more degrees

of freedom. Finally we propose that the orientation, persistency and

width of the discontinuity sets of calcareous rock masses can be

reconstructed by means of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) campaign.

COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology is an intergovernmental

framework aimed at facilitating the collaboration and networking of scientists

and researchers at European level. It was established in 1971 by 19 member

countries and currently includes 35 member countries across Europe, and Israel

as a cooperating state.

COST funds pan-European, bottom-up networks of scientists and researchers

across all science and technology fields. These networks, called 'COST Actions',

promote international coordination of nationally-funded research. By fostering

the networking of researchers at an international level, COST enables break-

through scientific developments leading to new concepts and products, thereby

contributing to strengthening Europe’s research and innovation capacities.

COST’s mission focuses in particular on: building capacity by connecting high

quality scientific communities throughout Europe and worldwide; providing

networking opportunities for early career investigators; increasing the impact of

research on policy makers, regulatory bodies and national decision makers as

well as the private sector.

Through its inclusiveness, COST supports the integration of research

communities, leverages national research investments and addresses issues of

global relevance. Every year thousands of European scientists benefit from being

involved in COST Actions, allowing the pooling of national research funding to

achieve common goals.

As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST anticipates and

complements the activities of EU Framework Programmes, constituting a “bridge”

towards the scientific communities of emerging countries. In particular, COST

Actions are also open to participation by non-European scientists coming from

neighbour countries (for example Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,

Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, the

Palestinian Authority, Russia, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine) and from a number of

international partner countries.

COST's budget for networking activities has traditionally been provided by

successive EU RTD Framework Programmes. COST is currently executed by the

European Science Foundation (ESF) through the COST Office on a mandate by

the European Commission, and the framework is governed by a Committee of

Senior Officials (CSO) representing all its 35 member countries.

More information about COST is available at www.cost.eu.



The scientific activities of the COST Action TU1208 are carried out within

four Working Groups (WGs). The effectiveness of this scheme will be checked

after the first year of activities and will eventually be modified, considering the

actual number of active participants in each WG. The structure of each WG

will always be kept as flexible as possible, in order to enable new participants

to join. All the participants, when joining the Action, are invited to provide

basic information on their experience, interests, and current research projects,

as well as WGs and Projects preferences. Each participant can belong to two

WGs and an arbitrary number of projects within the chosen WGs.

The four TU1208 WGs are: WG1 – Novel GPR instrumentation; WG2 – GPR

surveying of pavements, bridges, tunnels and buildings; underground utility

and void sensing; WG3 – EM methods for near-field scattering problems by

buried structures and data processing techniques; WG4 – Different

applications of GPR and other NDT technologies in civil engineering. The WG

meetings constitute an opportunity to present activities, results and plans for

the future. Between meetings, the WG members regularly interact.
