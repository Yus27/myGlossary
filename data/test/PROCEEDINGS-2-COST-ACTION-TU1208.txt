PREFACE


TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE


2014 WORKING GROUP PROGRESS MEETING



COST ACTION TU1208

“CIVIL ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR”



The 2014 Working Group Progress Meeting of the COST Action TU1208

“Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar” was held

at the French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport,

Development and Networks (IFSTTAR) in Nantes, France, on February

24-25, 2014.

Over 30 delegates from both academia and industry actively

participated to the meeting, being engaged in a series of presentations,

discussions and brainstorming sessions, concerning the Ground

Penetrating Radar (GPR) use in civil engineering tasks.

The main focus of the meeting was on the following topics: (i)

inspection procedures for effective GPR surveying of critical transport

infrastructures and buildings; (ii) inspection procedures for effective GPR

sensing and mapping of underground utilities and voids in urban areas;

(iii) inspection procedures for effective GPR monitoring of construction

materials; (iv) determination, through the use of a GPR system, of water

content in structures, foundations and soil; (v) advanced techniques for

the solution of forward and inverse electromagnetic near-field scattering

problems by complex scenarios; (vi) shape-reconstruction and

quantitative estimation of electromagnetic and physical properties from

GPR data; (vii) processing of GPR data collected during civil engineering

surveys.



We were honoured to have Prof. Antonis Giannopoulos (The University of

Edinburgh, United Kingdom) and Dr. Craig Warren (Early-Stage

Reseaercher (ESR), Edinburgh Napier University, United Kingdom)

holding a special Workshop on “Computational Electromagnetics with

the Finite-Difference Time-Domain technique.” The programme of this

workshop was to resume the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)

method and the potentialities of the well-known versatile and accurate

GprMax software (www.gprmax.org), as well as to talk about some

advanced topics like the modelling of complex structures and of

inhomogeneous media with stochastically distributed parameters, for

realistic electromagnetic representations of GPR antennas, construction

materials and soils.

Numerical methods are needed in order to solve Maxwell’s

equations in complicated and realistic problems, as modeling the GPR

response in civil engineering scenarios. Over the years a number of

numerical methods have been developed to do so. The FDTD method is

considered to be one of the most attractive choices, basically because of

its simplicity, speed and accuracy. Kane Yee first introduced FDTD in

1966. Since then, it has been established and developed to be a very

rigorous and well defined numerical method for solving Maxwell’s

equations. The order characteristics, accuracy and limitations are

rigorously and mathematically defined. This makes FDTD reliable and

easy to use. GprMax is a very useful and freeware tool implementing

FDTD in 2D and 3D, which can be used in order to give insight into the

electromagnetic scattering mechanisms and as an alternative approach

to aid data interpretation. Numerical modelling with GprMax can be

performed for a wide range of GPR applications in civil engineering,

archeology, geophysics, landmine detection, and so on. In civil

engineering, some applications of numerical modelling include the

estimation of the effectiveness of GPR to detect voids in bridges, to detect

metal bars in concrete, to estimate shielding effectiveness, etc. The main

challenges in numerical modelling of GPR for civil engineering

applications are: the implementation of the dielectric properties of the

involved media in a realistic way, the implementation of the geometrical

characteristics of the media (soils inhomogeneity, rough surfaces,

vegetation, concrete features like fractures and rock fragments), and of

course the modelling of the GPR transmitting and receiving antennas.

During the workshop, basic information about FDTD was provided. The

main features and commands of GprMax were presented in detail, how

to prepare input files was explained, numerical results were presented.

An accurate and realistic implementation of GPR antenna units, based

on general characteristics of the commercial antennas GSSI 1.5 GHz and

MALA 1.2 GHz, was carefully described, too. Results of measurements

were shown, made in different oil-in-water emulsions, which were used

to simulate materials with different permittivity and conductivity;

comparisons of the measured and modelled data show a very good

correlation, which validates the use of the antenna models for further

studies.



An interesting visit to the IFSTTAR test sites took place. In particular,

participants could visit the geophysical test site, the Accelerated

Pavement Testing (APT) facility and the geotechnical centrifuge.

The geophysical test site is an open-air laboratory including a

large and deep area, filled with various materials arranged in horisontal

compacted slices, separated by vertical interfaces and water-tighted in

surface; several objects as pipes, polystyrene hollows, boulders and

masonry are embedded in the field.

The full-scale APT facility is an outdoor circular carousel

dedicated to full-scale pavement experiments, consisting of a central

tower and four long arms equipped with wheels, running on a circular

test track. In particular, the loading system includes two wheel

assemblies: the first one runs on an inner track, 30 m in diameter, the

second one runs on an outer track, 40 m in diameter. Loads from 40 kN

up to 75 kN can be applied, at speeds of up to 105 km/h. It is possible

to simulate tandem axles of 280 kN at lower speeds as well as to

simulate single wheel-loading. The APT is highly active, with extensive

ongoing research studies involving universities, researcher centers and

enterprises.

The geotechnical centrifuge is an indoor experimental facility,

which is useful for the testing of physical-scale models of geotechnical

engineering systems, such as natural and man-made slopes and earth

retaining structures, or building or bridge foundations. The scale models

are constructed in the laboratory and then loaded onto the end of the

centrifuge. The purpose of spinning the models on the centrifuge is to

increase the g-forces on the model, so that stresses in the model are

equal to stresses in the prototype in Earth’s gravity. The idea to use

centrifugal acceleration to simulate increased gravitational acceleration

was first proposed by Phillips in 1869 and it is still extremely valid. The

IFSTTAR geotechnical centrifuge has a capacity to place a 2 tonnes

model at a centrifuge acceleration of 100g; its radius is 5.5 m and the

platform of the swinging basket that supports the model is 1.4 m x 1.1

m. It is also possible to perform earthquake simulation tests, to this aim

a shaking table set can be added in the basket of the centrifuge so that a

horisontal acceleration simulating the bedrock acceleration during the

earthquake is superimposed to the static vertical centrifuge acceleration

modelling the gravity.

The IFSTTAR geophysical test site and APT represent the perfect

location for the comparison of different GPR equipment and surveying

procedures.



Keynote lectures were given by Prof. Andreas Tzanis (University of

Athens, Greece) and Dr. Janne Poikajarvi (Lapland University of Applied

Sciences, Finland).

Prof. Andreas Tzanis presented the well-known matGPR software

that

he

developed

(users.uoa.gr/~atzanis/matgpr/matgpr.html),

providing a broad and functional range of tools for the analysis of zero

and single-offset GPR data. He also gave an overview on GPR data

processing, suggesting open issues and possible future developments in

this area. The matGPR programme is implemented in Matlab and is

available for free. It is a two-layered software system, in which the

bottom layer comprises a suite of functions to handle, display and

process the data, while the top layer organizes these functions by means

of a GUI. At present matGPR can import GPR single-channel raw data in

the formats of the manufacturers GSSI, Måla Geophysics, Sensors and

Software and ZOND, as well as data stored in Seismic Unix and SEG-Y

Revisions 0 and 1 formats. The software offers a collection of basic and

advanced GPR processing utilities, imaging (migration) and modelling

tools, routines to generate 2D and 3D GPR data pictures. This powerful

tool is of great interest for Working Group 3 of our Action.

Dr. Janne Poikajarvi presented the Mara Nord Project, recently

carried out in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The project objectives were

to demonstrate the potential of GPR in road-condition measurement and

rehabilitation planning, to benchmark different available GPR systems,

to create joint Nordic Scandinavian Recommendations, and to offer a

GPR training programme to road administrations and to companies.

Concerning recommendations, during the Mara Nord project five

different joint guidelines were developed, to address the different types of

surveys most commonly performed on road surveys: use of GPR in

pavement design and road rehabilitation projects, use of GPR in bridge

applications, use of GPR in site investigation, use of GPR in road

construction quality control, use of GPR in asphalt quality control. The

project is of huge interest for Working Group 2 of our Action and Dr.

Poikajarvi clearly described not only the achieved results, but also how

the project was carried out step by step, how road authorities played an

important role to define the recommendations, how the training sessions

were organised. All the project reports, guidelines and slides of the

training are available at maranord.ramk.fi.

On Monday, a series of presentations and discussions on Working Group

3 topics took place.

Dr. Cristina Ponti (ESR, Roma Tre University, Italy) presented the

progress report on Project 3.1 “Development of advanced methods for the

solution of forward electromagnetic scattering problems by buried

structures,” describing the progress that has been done since July 2013

by the project’s participants, on the topic of the modeling of forward

electromagnetic scattering by buried objects. These research activities

aim at providing tools for an advanced modeling of civil engineering

scenarios, in order to improve the understanding of data collected by

GPR systems.

Dr. Nicolas Pinel (ESR, Alyotech, France) presented his work on

the modelling of electromagnetic scattering by rough layers through the

Method of Moments and its application to roadways. This is a

contribution to Project 3.1 of our Action.

Subsequently, Dr. Christelle Eyraud (ESR, Institut Fresnel,

France) presented her work on the modelling of the electromagnetic field

emitted by a GPR horn antenna by means of a suitable set of current

lines; the method has been applied to the near-subsurface imaging of a

two-dimensional object embedded in an absorbing medium and

numerical results have been compared with experimental data collected

by a multistatic single-frequency scanner. This is a contribution to both

Projects 3.1 and 3.2; it could be interesting to integrate the method in

the CWA and also to exploit it in GprMax2D.

Dr. Albéric De Coster (ESR, Université Catholique de Louvain,

Belgium) presented, on behalf of Prof. Sébastien Lambot, the progress

report on Project 3.3 “Development of intrinsic models for describing

near-field antenna effects, including antenna-medium coupling, for

improved radar data processing using full-wave inversion,” describing

how activities went on since July 2013.

Finally, Prof. Jan Van Der Kruk (Forschungszentrum Jülich,

Germany), who recently joined COST Action TU1208, gave a talk on the

state of the art and open issues in the field of Full-Waveform Inversion

(FWI), one of the most promising but also challenging data fitting

techniques that is able to use advanced modeling programs to derive

quantitative relative permittivity and conductivity values from GPR data.

Recent developments were discussed concerning FWI of experimental off-

ground, crosshole, and on-ground GPR data. This is a contribution to

Projects 3.2 and 3.4 of the Action.



On Tuesday, a series of presentations and discussions on Working

Group 2 topics took place.

Dr. Josef Stryk (Centrum Dopravního Výzkumu, Czech Republic)

presented the progress report on Project 2.1 “Innovative inspection

procedures for effective GPR surveying of critical transport

infrastructures (pavements, bridges and tunnels).” He described the

studies that have been carried out since July 2013 by the project’s

participants on the topics covered by Project, updated participants

attending the meeting on the ongoing cooperation with EuroGPR

Association, presented the Czech National Project connected to COST

Action TU1208 and the first results of an experimental activity on

continual measurement of the thickness of asphalt layers. He also

presented a questionnaire, which was developed in cooperation with the

Action’s Chair, WG2 Chair and WG2 Vice-Chair and proposed to the

participants of Project 2.1; preliminary results of the survey are already

available.

Prof. Gracia Vega-Perez (Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña,

Spain) presented the state of the art and open issues concerning Project

2.2 “Innovative inspection procedures for effective GPR surveying of

buildings.” For this project, the state of the art report was not presented

during the First General Meeting of our COST Action, as Project 2.2

started later with respect to the other projects.

Dr. Xavier Dérobert (IFSTTAR, France) presented the progress

report for Project 2.3 “Innovative inspection procedures for effective GPR

sensing and mapping of underground utilities and voids, with a focus to

urban areas” and he also presented the template for a catalogue of

European GPR test sites, developed in cooperation with the Action’s

Chair and the WG2 Chair, to be proposed to all the Action’s Members.

Dr. Lech Krysinski (Road and Bridge Research Institute, Poland)

presented the progress report for Project 2.4 “Innovative procedures for

effective GPR inspection of construction materials and structures,”

providing basic information about participants, list of project topics and

ongoing research activities related to the project.

Dr. Zoubi Mehdi Sbartai (University of Bordeaux, France)

presented a review on his research activity, concerning the evaluation of

moisture content using GPR, as a contribution to Project 2.5. He mainly

focused on the evaluation of moisture content in concrete, by using

electromagnetic techniques as permittivity measurement using weak

perturbation method and GPR.

Dr. Christiane Trela (Federal Institute for Materials Research and

Testing (BAM), Germany) gave a talk about GPR activities at BAM. The

BAM laboratories are excellent test sites for the comparison of different

surveying procedures and equipment on concrete structures, with

advanced experimental facilities and the possibility to construct accurate

test specimens made of concrete, masonry, sand and gravels, etc., with

different structural elements embedded in them (rebars, tendon ducts,

cavities, honey combs, etc.) and under various conditions (wetness, salt

content, temperatur, mechanical stress, accelerated corrosion, etc.). At

BAM, a training course on non-destructive testing and evaluation for

civil engineering applications is regularly organised and its content was

presented by Dr. Trela, as well.

Dr. Colette Gregoire (Belgium Road Research Center (BRRC),

Belgium) gave a talk on GPR activities for road applications at the BRRC

(evaluation of the road structure with deflections measurements,

estimation of the origin of road damages and collapse, evaluation of the

risk of instability of concrete slabs, detection of cables or pipes before

works, etc). They recently bought a GPR system and are carrying out a

research project aiming at the establishment of standard methodologies

for acquisition, processing and interpretation of radar measurements

that are specific for road investigation. In order to calibrate the radar

equipment and to perform measurements in controlled conditions, they

constructed a small test site with different road specimens.

Subsequently, talks were given by new Working Group 2

Members, who recently joined our COST Action. Dr. Pekka Hanninen

(Geological Survey of Finland, Finland) presented his research activities

on snow and frost GPR-monitoring in suburban areas. Prof. Simona

Fontul (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil, Portugal) gave a talk

on GPR research activities carried out in the National Laboratory for

Civil Engineering, in Lisbon. Dr. Roger Wisen (Rambøll, Denmark)

presented Rambøll activities, in Denmark, and a GPR system that they

use for efficient 3D surveying in civil engineering tasks.



A presentation on COST Short Term Scientific Missions (STSMs) and

COST Conference Grants was given by Dr. Lara Pajewski (Roma Tre

University, Italy). COST strives to support European scientists in their

networking activities: STSMs allow scientists to learn from an institution

or laboratory in another COST Country - a concept of particular interest

to young scientists. STSMs can vary from one week to three months, and

up to six months for Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), having their PhD

since no more than eight years; applicants must be engaged in a

research programme in an Institution from a COST Country which must

have accepted the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of the Action

concerned, and the host institution has to be in a COST country

participating in the COST Action as well. The average contribution for a

mission is a fixed grant based on the applicant’s budget request and the

decision from the relevant assessment committee. COST Conference

Grants are offered by the COST scientific domains three times per year;

these grants are for ESRs, to participate in an international conference

outside of the COST Action activities.

Afterwards, an open discussion took place, concerning the organisation

of the next Action’s events, possible dissemination initiatives, and

preliminary ideas about the submission of joint Horizon 2020 proposals,

as well as ideas about the possibility of submitting NATO Science for

Peace proposals for a Training School and for a Workshop (in

cooperation with the Mara Nord team). Finally, we had parallel

brainstorming sessions for Working Groups 2 and 3.



We are deeply grateful to COST, for funding the COST Action TU1208,

the 2014 Working Progress Meeting and the publication of this volume,

and to the Institut Français des Sciences et Technologies des

Transports, de l'Aménagement et des Réseaux, for hosting the event and

“matGPR: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION”



Andreas Tzanis - Department of Geophysics, University of Athens

atzanis@geol.uoa.gr





Abstract



The Ground Probing Radar (GPR) has become an invaluable means of

exploring shallow structures for geoscientific, engineering environmental

and archaeological work. At the same time, GPR analysis software is

mostly proprietary and expensive. The academic freeware community has

been slow to react and the limited free software is usually highly focused

on specific problems and generally unorganized. This paper describes the

result of a continued effort to produce a cross-platform freeware analysis

and interpretation package, which can also be expandable and

customizable to the requirements of a particular user with relatively little

programming effort. MATLAB ™ is an ideal platform for the development of

such a kind of software, as it offers a complete programming environments

and solutions for the development of advanced analysis software. The

result of this undertaking, matGPR Release 2, is a GUI-driven, user

friendly program providing a quite broad and functional range of tools for

the analysis and visualization of zero and single-offset GPR data collected

with several different types of instruments. However, the effort is by no

means complete: notwithstanding its present utility, one can think of a

multitude of analysis tools that can and will be included in future releases

of matGPR, which will be available to the interested GPR practitioner in the

spirit of the GNU project.



I. GENERAL FEATURES AND ORGANIZATION



matGPR is a two-layered software system, in which the bottom layer

comprises a suite of functions to handle, display, inspect and process

the data, while the top layer organizes these functions, automating data

management and streamlining the flow of work.%

%

Figure 1. The matGPR GUI, complete with information about the data

being handled and its processing history. %

The top layer and backbone of the program is realized in the form of the

matGPR GUI (Figure 1). Data management decisions are made with the

appropriate choices under the Data menu. Visualization and inspection

is facilitated by utilities offered in the View menu, while processing and

interpretation utilities can be found in the Basic Handling, Filtering,

Imaging and Modeling menus. The 3D-View menu provides a suite of

functions to assemble, manipulate and visualize three-dimensional GPR

data volumes and the Windows menu offers a fast navigation and

window-switching service exclusive to matGPR. Finally, the About menu

includes the on-line help and updater services.

The operation of the program is quite simple and succinctly outlined in

Figure 2: work flows in a continuous cycle between the current Input

Data, i.e. that data before some processing operation (step) and the

Output Data, i.e. the data resulting from this operation. One may

import, display and inspect the Input Data with the appropriate choices

under the Data and View menus. Then one decides and applies a

%

processing step and displays/ inspects the result, i.e. the Output Data.

If satisfied, one keeps (holds) the result, replacing the Input Data with

the Output Data and repeats the cycle with a new processing step. If

not, one may discard the result and cycle with another processing step.

A multi-level undo/ restore utility is available at any time at which

control is returned to the matGPR GUI. The Input Data may also be

saved/ exported via the matGPR GUI. Soft and hard copies of the Input

and Output Data (and any figure produced during a session), can be

made at any time using the FigureTools menu of the figure windows (see

below). The IPD and OPD structures are accessible through MATLAB's

base workspace and can be used or manipulated independently.

matGPR is a modular program With the exception of the management

and direct visualization utilities each module performs a self-contained

operation. In Figure 2, a module is displayed as a subprogram which

includes (calls) the analysis function F{IPD, R}, where R is the set of

parameters required for the execution of F. Now, consider that M-code

(MATLAB’s language) executes rather slowly, on account of being

interpreted and not compiled. This may be a serious shortcoming when

it comes to computationally intensive tasks. However, MATLAB offers

three solutions.

• It makes an honest effort to use an efficient programming style: for

many applications, vectorized and well-written M-code is as fast as

compiled code, to the point of being competitive.

• It can integrate fast, compiled C or FORTRAN code with M-code by

means of the MEX-file concept. The FORTRAN-MEX sources are

included in the distribution bundle, so that the MEX-file may be

(re)built if its functionality is somehow lost.

• It provides a set of alternative (computationally intensive) functions

that drive external, stand-alone FORTRAN executables to do the

number crunching.

Details about which processes use MEX-files or alternative functions

and how to implement them can be found in the matGPR

Documentation.

The modular architecture of matGPR allows one to expand the program

with new analysis modules easily and without having to know many

details about the program’s infrastructure. At any rate, familiarity with

the MATLAB language and graphical object manipulations in particular,

is necessary. The matGPR Documentation provides detailed instructions

of how to expand the program.



II. INPUT AND OUTPUT UTILITIES



matGPR can import raw data in the formats of the GPR manufacturers

GSSI (DZT), Måla Geophysics (RD3), Sensors and Software (DT1) and

ZOND (SEG-Y), as well as data stored in Seismic Unix (SU) and SEG-Y

Revision 0 and Revision 1 formats. Only single-channel data files are

acceptable, inasmuch as matGPR is currently being offered for zero- or

single-offset surveys.

With reference to RAMAC/ RD3 data, as of Release 3 it is possible to

import and assimilate GPS trace positioning, if available, by decoding the

associated .cor file where GPS information is stored. The positions of the

GPS-located traces are projected in the UTM coordinate system and are

treated as marker traces: they are stored in the IPD.markertr field

whence they can be manipulated in various ways.

With reference to bistatic Pulse Ekko (DT1) radars, only data recorded in

reflection mode (single-offset) are fully supported. Multiple-offset data,

(e.g. CMP gathers) can be imported and displayed, but at this stage of

development, matGPR does not offer any processing utilities beyond

rudimentary editing and filtering.

Prior to importing any raw data and at any time during a matGPR

session, the user can inspect the complete information held in the file

header of any one of the supported data formats.

Consecutive or broken sections can be joined into a single data set via a

specialized GUI.

matGPR can save the IPD either in the native MGP-file format (default),

or in MATLAB binary format (native MAT-file), for long-term storage and

fast access during subsequent analysis sessions. The current IPD can be

saved at any time during a processing session.

For distribution or exchange, the data can be exported to SEG-Y

Revision 1, SU and DZT file format.

It is possible to undo any number of processing steps in order to restore

the data to a previous state. A GUI facilitates this operation and lets the

user decide at which state he/she desires to restore the data. The

number of undo’s is user specified and can be changed during runtime.



III. DATA VISUALIZATION AND PROPERTIES



Data visualization options include image (colour-graded) displays with

several colour maps, wiggle-trace displays, variable-area displays as well

as their combinations. Utilities are also provided to:

%

%

43%

%





%

%

%

%

• Change the colour map and colour scheme of image displays.

• Edit the colour scheme, zoom, pan, peek elements (pixels) of the data

matrix, export the display in all standard graphics formats, print the

display and edit the display figure, the data axes figure and their

children objects.



It is also possible to display, zoom, pan, peek, export, print, edit and

evaluate:

• Individual IPD and OPD traces.

• Individual IPD and OPD trace spectra.

• The time-frequency characteristics of IPD and OPD traces.

• The attenuation characteristics of the IPD and OPD.

• The instantaneous attributes of the IPD radargram.

• The centroid frequency of the IPD radargram.



IV. BASIC PROCESSING



matGPR offers a collection of rudimentary and data handling

(conditioning) procedures that include:

• Graphically assisted determination and adjustment of time-zero.

• Graphically assisted Time-Window Trimming. It is common for the

later parts of the traces to contain noise; matGPR allows one to

reduce of the size of the radargram by discarding late-time arrivals. In

combination with time-zero adjustment, this is useful for extracting a

certain part of the data for some specific purpose.

• Graphically assisted Spatial-Window trimming. This allows one to

discard traces at the beginning or the end of the radargram, or extract

parts of the radargram to a separate data set.

• Graphically assisted elimination of errant traces appearing singular or

in small groups (for instance due to the antenna coupling with local

ground features or bouncing on small obstacles).

• Per-trace DC component removal.

• Dewow filtering.

• Trace Equalization.

%

• Gain Manipulation with the following options: 1) Standard Automatic

Gain Control (AGC); 2) Gaussian-tapered AGC (Automatic Gain

Control); 3) Inversion of Amplitude Decay, which applies a smooth

empirical gain function that exactly compensates the mean or median

amplitude attenuation observed in a radargram; 4) Inversion of Power

Decay, which applies an inverse power-law compensation of the mean

or median power attenuation and may also be used for the spherical

divergence correction.

• Resampling (increase or decrease of the sampling-rate) in time and/or

space with band limited sinc interpolation.

• Marker Interpolation and Trace Positioning utilities. These include:

editing and management of marker traces, i.e., traces whose locations

are a priori assigned with reference to a local coordinate frame;

transformation of data collected in equal-time spacing mode, to data

at equal-distance spacing for GPR instruments without survey wheels

or other automatic triggering devices - this can be done by piecewise

cubic Hermite polynomial interpolation between marker traces, or by

stacking with reference to the location of the marker traces;

assignment of x, y and z coordinates to the IPD traces by reference to

the known coordinates of marker traces - this information can be

used in the application of static corrections (see below), as well as for

2D and 3D data visualization.

• Planning and execution of batch jobs (sequential processing) on single

or multiple data sets (IPDs). All operations available for batch-mode

execution pertain to data conditioning; those manipulating structural

or geometric information are deliberately not included in a batch job.

Operations available for execution in batch mode include: 1) Time-

zero adjustment; 2) Time window Trimming; 3) Per-trace subtraction

of the DC component; 4) Dewow; 5) Standard Automatic Gain Control;

6) Gaussian-tapered AGC; 7) Amplification by the Inverse Power

Decay method; 8) Amplification by the Inverse Amplitude Decay

method; 9) Modification of the sampling rate; 10) Modification of trace

spacing; 11) Trace equalization; 12) Global Background (mean trace)

subtraction; 13) Karhunen – Loeve Filtering; 14) FIR Frequency

Filtering; 15) B-Spline Wavelet Filtering; 16) F-X Deconvolution; 17)

V. ADVANCED PROCESSING



matGPR offers an extensive suite of advanced to very advanced

processing utilities. These include:

• Mean and median spatial filtering in one and two dimensions.

• Foreground/ Background Trace manipulation:

• Background (mean) trace subtraction to reduce source effects.

• Removal of a sliding window’s mean (background) trace to expose

high-angle dipping reflections.

• Removal of a sliding-window's "foreground" traces to eliminate high-

angle reflections and enhance horizontal (e.g. hydrogeologic features).

• Karhunen–Loeve filtering based on a low-dimensional subspace

approximation of the radargram. This is extremely useful in

eliminating small-scale data components to enhance lateral

coherence, or very large-scale (low frequency/ short wavenumber)

spatio-temporal components and noise (e.g. banding).

• Graphically assisted design and implementation of zero-phase FIR

filtering (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop and notch), in

the frequency domain (applied 'vertically' to traces), or, in the

wavenumber domain (applied 'horizontally' to equally spaced traces).

• Interactive (graphically assisted) F-K filter design and implementation,

facilitating the application of zone pass/stop filters, fan filters and up-

dip/ down-dip mapping in the frequency - wavenumber domain.

• Advanced S/N enhancement and orientation-and-scale-sensitive data

manipulation and information retrieval with: orientation-and-scale

selective 2-D Wavelet and Gabor Filters, tunable multidirectional

scale-selective 2-D Wavelet and Gabor Filters, and graphically

assisted multi-scale & multidirectional curvelet based optimal

filtering.

• Interactive (graphically assisted) Tau-P domain modelling and

filtering.

• F-X Deconvolution for the suppression of random noise.

• Predictive Deconvolution to suppress multiple reflections and other

reverberation (e.g. banding) in 2-D radargrams.

• Sparse Deconvolution to estimate a maximally parsimonious

reflectivity structure of the subsurface.

VI. DATA IMAGING



matGPR offers a collection of imaging (migration) and modeling tools to

assist in the interpretation. These require velocity analysis and velocity

models constructed with in-house utilities. Notably, some migration

routines incorporate frequency dependence of the phase velocity due to

the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant, (resistivity and

magnetic permeability are assumed to be constant). matGPR also

provides a utility to manually calculate phase velocities. At present,

“velocity analysis” means the graphically assisted manual fitting of

diffraction front hyperbolae based on the premise of non-dispersive

propagation in a uniform halfspace and targets comprising point

diffractors, or finite sized objects with quasi-circular cross section.

Imaging utilities include:

• Static (topographic) corrections (elevation data is necessary).

• 1-D Migration. The required uniform or layered velocity model may be

generated internally via the hyperbola fitting procedure, imported

from a disk file or supplied via an appropriate UI dialog box (the Get

1-D Velocity Model utility under the Imaging menu). One-dimensional

migration techniques include: 1) F-K Time Migration for uniform or

layered velocity structures (uses Stolt stretching to account for

layered velocity structures); 2) Phase-Shifting Time Migration for

uniform or layered velocity structures; 3) 1-D Depth Migration. The 1-

D Depth Migration algorithm implemented in matGPR follows a rather

complex procedure: first, it computes a time vs. depth function t(z)

from the velocity vs. depth function v(t) and inverts it to z(t) by inverse

%

%





%

%

%

%

linear interpolation. Next, it remaps z(t) to depth z and, based on this

function, remaps a trace y(t) to a trace y(z).

• 2-D Depth Migration. The necessary two-dimensional velocity model

may either be read from a disk file, or generated by a suitable utility

form a synthetic structural model previously prepared by the Model

Builder utility specified in §5. The available options are: 1) Phase-shift

Plus Interpolation (PSPI) migration for zero-offset data. The PSPI

migration routine uses only the non-dispersive phase velocity term

because, at present, there’s no accurate method to interpolate the

dispersive terms in the sense required by the Gazdag and Sguazzero

algorithm. 2) 2-D Split-step Migration augmented to account for

frequency dependence of the phase velocity (dispersion).

VII. MODELLING



matGPR offers a utility, the Model Builder, to facilitate graphically

assisted construction of 2-D structural models for use with the 2-D

Depth Migration methods and for forward modelling. Each structural

model comprises an ensemble of objects with polygonal or circular cross-

sections and may be edited, saved and modified indefinitely. The model

editing utilities include:

• Graphically assisted deletion of old objects or/and insertion of new

objects.

• Graphically assisted modification of an object’s geometry by

relocation, removal of old vertices and insertion of new vertices

(modifications may be undone).

• Interactive modification of an object’s properties (dielectric constant,

resistivity and magnetic permeability).

• Visualization enhancement utilities (e.g. colouring).

matGPR includes two modelling methods, both of which require

synthetic structural models constructed with the Model Builder:

• A fast, Adjoint Split-Step approach, (modified and expanded method

of Bitri and Grandjean, Geophysical Prospecting, 46, 287-301, 1998).

%

%

%

%

This is a fast and relatively dirty approach, lacking in detail (does not

model secondary effects like multiples), and possibly prone to artifacts

if applied indiscriminately. Conversely, it is efficient enough to

effectively supplement the interpretation.

• The slow but precise Finite Difference Time-Domain method of Irving

and Knight (Computers & Geosciences, 32, 1247–1258, 2006).

VIII. 3-D VISUALIZATION



matGPR offers a suite of functions to generate three-dimensional GPR

data volumes using a stacking technique: It is assumed that the 3-D

GPR survey has been conducted in a local co-ordinate system in which:

• Radargrams can have any shape, length, orientation and trace

spacing with respect to the coordinate axes.

• The vertical axis can be either time or depth and the data do not need

to have the same time window sizes or sampling rates, or depth

window sizes, or depth spacing.

• Volumes can be created for absolute trace values, squared trace

values, absolute-log trace values, instantaneous trace amplitude and

instantaneous trace power.



The stacking procedure is as follows: The data files (in MGP and/or MAT

formats only) are read in. For each file, traces that fall within a two-

dimensional horizontal search window around a volume cell are

transformed and stacked together. After all the data files have been

processed, the final volume cell value is calculated by averaging all

values added to it.

Visualization techniques include:

• The GPR-slice utility, to generate orthographic opaque or translucent

slices that are: 1) horizontal and perpendicular to the vertical grid

direction (z-axis); 2) vertical and perpendicular to the x-axis; 3)

vertical and perpendicular to the y-axis. Prior to displaying, each slice

may be smoothed with a robust discretized smoothing spline

technique. The horizontal and vertical size of the slices is controlled

by the user. Slices may be added or removed from the display, thus

enabling an arbitrarily intricate and detailed visualization of the data

volume. The user controls the azimuth and elevation of the viewing

(contrast) of the display.

• Isosurface displays, i.e., orthographic representations of the data in

the form of lit isometric surfaces with equal signal amplitudes, or less%

rigorously stated lit surfaces of equal reflectivity. The user may

manipulate the display by: 1) specifying the isosurface value (signal

amplitude); 2) specifying the azimuth and elevation of the viewer

position; 3) specifying the aspect ratio of the display and the direction

of lighting (light position); 4) specifying the colour of the iso-surface.

• The 3-D Slices utility, to visualize the entire data volume with

orthographic opaque or translucent slices parallel to the x-axis.

Horizontal slices perpendicular to the z-axis and vertical slices

perpendicular to the y-axis can be overlaid one at a time. The user

controls the azimuth and elevation of the viewing position, the aspect

ratio and the colour saturation of the display.

“DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED METHODS FOR THE SOLUTION OF FORWARD

ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING BY BURIED OBJECTS”

PROGRESS REPORT ON PROJECT 3.1

During the first year of the Cost Action TU1208, progress has been done

on the topic of the modeling of forward electromagnetic scattering by

buried structures, by the involved participants. Such research activities

make an effort to provide an advanced modeling of GPR surveys in order

to improve their understanding.

In [1], the integral equation solved with Method of Moments are

addressed to evaluate the scattering by canonical objects, as a cylinder

or a plate, by a randomly rough surface, and also by an object below or

above a flat or rough surface. In the same book, the MoM is also

combined with Extended- Propagation Inside Layer Method (E-PILE) to

efficiently solve the scattering by two scatterers, i.e. a coated cylinder, a

cylinder below a flat or rough surface, or two rough surfaces. In [2], the

PILE method is used to validate an asymptotic technique, the Kirchhoff

Tangent Plane approach, in order to evaluate the coherent scattering

from a rough layer. In [3], it is shown how to calculate the frequency and

time responses of the field scattered by three homogeneous media

separated by two random rough surfaces through the PILE. In this

paper, the PILE is also applied to simulate nondestructive pavement

survey through ground penetrating radar (GPR) at nadir angle, by a

Ricker pulse. In [4]-[5], the PILE method provides the simulation data to

estimate time delay and surface parameters in GPR pavement surveys.

Further progress has been done in the time domain with integro-

differential equations. In [5], an analytical solution of the time domain

Pocklington integro-differential equation for the transient current flowing

along the horizontal grounding electrode of finite length buried in a lossy

half-space is given. The modeling of a horizontal grounding electrode has

applications to the design of Grounding and Lighting Protection

Systems. Simplified reflection coefficient arising from the modified image

theory is used to take into account the influence of the earth–air

interface. A procedure for the calculation of the transient impedance of

the horizontal grounding electrode is developed in [6], using antenna

theory. The Pocklington integro-differential equation modeling the

grounding electrode is solved in the frequency domain, both numerically

and analytically, thus obtaining the solution for the current induced

along the electrode. Antenna theory applied to the modeling of the

grounding electric dipole is also presented in [7], for the evaluation of the

input and transient impedance. Progress on this topic has been also

reported in [9]-[11]. A novel TM reflection coefficient function for the TM

polarization has been presented in [8].

On the side analytical techniques, in [12], some numerical aspects of the

Cylindrical Wave Approach (CWA) are discussed, also through

comparisons with finite elements method simulations. In [12], the CWA

is used in its original formulations for scatterers buried in a semi-infinite

medium, below a flat interface. The fundamental of the methods are the

use of cylindrical waves as basis functions of the scattered fields, and

spectral representations of the relevant cylindrical functions to solve

reflection and transmission of such waves. In [14], the CWA has been

solved in the case of targets buried in a lossy medium. The CWA has

been also extended to the modeling of advanced scattering scenarios in

[15]-[19]. In [15], CWA has been implemented in a multiple-reflection

approach to solve the scattering by cylindrical targets placed below a

dielectric wall. The proposed geometry is suitable for both geophysical

modeling of a layered ground as well as simulations of targets concealed

by the wall of a building. Numerical simulations for these scattering

problems are reported in [16]. In [17]-[18], CWA has been combined with

first order Small Perturbation Method to solve the scattering by a

circular cross-section cylinder placed below a rough surface with

arbitrary profile. In the numerical solution, the samples of the surfaces

have been taken from a Gaussian distribution, and the surface profile

has been generated on a periodic surface length. In [19] and [20], two

different sources for the modeling of the GPR excitation, in the frame of

This paper presents the rigorous efficient PILE (Propagation-Inside-Layer

Expansion) numerical method [1] and an extension of the Ament model

[2] to calculate the field scattered by three homogeneous media

separated by two random rough surfaces. Here, the study is applied to

ground penetrating radar (GPR) (nadir angle, wide band) for

nondestructive survey by taking the roughness of the surfaces into

account and by calculating the contribution of each echo coming from

the multiple scattering inside the layer. The application to roadways is

investigated.

The PILE method starts from the Method of Moments (MoM), and

the impedance matrix is inverted by blocks from the Taylor series

expansion of the inverse of the Schur complement. Its great advantage is

that it is rigorous, with a simple formulation and has a straightforward

physical interpretation. This last property relies on the fact that each

block of the impedance matrix is linked to a particular and quasi-

independent physical process occurring during the multiple scattering

between the two rough surfaces. Furthermore, the PILE method allows

us to use any acceleration algorithm developed for a single interface.

In addition, an asymptotic approach is extended to random rough

layered media: the scalar Kirchhoff-tangent plane approximation (SKA),

for calculating the coherent scattering from the rough layer. The

numerical rigorous PILE method is used as a reference to validate this

asymptotic model. The study focuses on 2D problems with so-called 1D

surfaces, for computational ease of the reference numerical method.

Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that the SKA approach can readily

be applied to 3D problems. This approach is applied to rough layers with

two independent slightly rough surfaces characterized by an exponential

correlation function. The height probability density function (PDF) is

assumed to be Gaussian.

The SKA model is shown to correctly predict the coherent

scattered field for typical configurations in pavement survey by GPR at

nadir, in the whole frequency band [0.5; 10] GHz [2].

By taking into account the time delay of each echo in this new

model, this direct simple electromagnetic model can be a good candidate

for its use in signal processing algorithms for the estimation of physical

parameters of the layer like its thickness H and also and more

important, for the estimation of the RMS (root mean square) heights of

the two rough interfaces simultaneously.

For the considered scenarios, she electromagnetic time responses

of the first two echoes have been computed by using both the PILE and

SKA methods and by considering, for the input signal, a Ricker pulse of

peak frequency fc = 2 GHz over the band [0.05; 7] GHz.

“NEAR-SUBSURFACE IMAGING IN AN ABSORBING EMBEDDING

MEDIUM WITH A MULTISTATIC/SINGLE FREQUENCY SCANNER”

Imaging the subsurface by means of non-destructive techniques is of

great interest in several practical day-life situations as for example civil

engineering [1], agricultural domain [2], archaeology [3], .... Moreover,

looking to the near-subsurface in presence of absorbing media is a very

challenging problem.

Within that framework, we analyse the capabilities of a mono-

frequency/multistatic set-up for detecting shallowly buried targets.

In order to compensate for the associated lack of information, and

as we want to take benefit from inverse scattering algorithms, we focus

on a multistatic set-up.

As the antennas constitute an important part of the probing

device, an accurate method for modelling the antennas behaviour is

proposed. This modelling, performed thanks to a correctly balanced set

of elementary sources, is then incorporated in the calculation of the

scattered field, performed with a home-made Finite Element Method

software [4].

Efforts have also been put into the measurement procedure. The

measured fields are thus post-processed with an efficient method which

takes profit of the spectral bandwidth properties of the scattered field.

These fields serve as input data for the inversion algorithm, an extension

of the DORT method to elongated targets [5].

This qualitative and fast imaging procedure, which exploits the

spectral properties of the multistatic scattering matrix, has been adapted

to the present stratified configuration.

Abstract



Ground penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used fool for high resolution

subsurface characterization because of its noninvasive character and the

fairly quick measurement acquisition. Compared to other non-destructive

techniques GPR is able to return high resolution images due to the use of

high frequency electromagnetic waves and in principle it is possible to

extract relative permittivity and electrical conductivity properties from the

data. Conventional inversion tools are often based on approximations that

include far-field, high-frequency ray-based approximations, and often only

part of the data is used. Due to the increased computation power, accurate

forward modeling programs can now be used for advanced inversion

algorithms where the complete measured data is used. Here, recent

developments of full-waveform Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) inversion

are discussed for off-ground, crosshole, and on-ground configurations that

yield higher resolution of quantitative medium properties compared to

conventional approaches.



I.





INTRODUCTION


GPR is often used to characterize civil engineering structures, such as

critical

transport

infrastructures,

underground

utilities,

and

construction materials. Mostly ray-based techniques are used to locate

subsurface scatterers or layer interfaces, where only part of the GPR

data is exploited. Improved GPR images can be obtained by including

advanced modeling tools that are able to calculate the propagation of

electromagnetic waves in complicated media configurations [1-4]. Full-

waveform inversion (FWI) is one of the most promising but also

challenging data!fitting techniques [5] that is able to use these advanced

modeling programs to derive quantitative relative permittivity and

conductivity values. Full!waveform inversion is fairly advanced in

exploration seismics [e.g. 5-7]). However, seismic full!waveform inversion

cannot be used for GPR inversion and dedicated inversion programs are

required that honor the pertaining vectorial wave propagation and

radiation patterns of GPR. In the following, recent developments will be

discussed of full-waveform inversion of experimental off-ground,

crosshole, and on-ground GPR data that indicate the benefits of FWI

inversion to estimate quantitative permittivity and conductivity values.



II. FULL-WAVEFORM INVERSION OF OFF-GROUND GPR



Off!ground GPR uses air launched horn antennas installed at a

sufficient height above the surface such that the emitted electric field

can be considered independent from the subsurface. Since mainly

vertical wave propagation occurs, horizontal layers are often assumed

when inverting the measured reflected waves. Exact-field expressions for

the electromagnetic wave propagation in a horizontally layered medium

can be used that assume a point source and receiver antennas.

To effectively describe the source and receiver horn antennas, that

guide the waves within the antenna until they spread spherically outside

the antenna, the phase center needs to be introduced which is the

virtual point from which the electromagnetic waves seem to be emitted

or received assuming point source and receiver antennas. To estimate

the phase center, reflections need to be measured that is reflected from a

steel plate for varying heights. In addition, an effective wavelet

estimation procedure needs to be implemented [8-10].

GPR data measured by a commercial GPR system for nine

homogeneous concrete specimens having different moisture and chloride

contents were inverted using the full-waveform inversion based on a

combined global-local search algorithm [10]. The inversion results for

almost all specimens showed for increasing chloride and humidity

content specimens increasing conductivity and permittivity values,

respectively. In contrast to traditional ray-based techniques, it was

possible to distinguish between moisture and chloride effects and to

obtain quantitative values for the permittivity and conductivity. For

increasing chloride content increasing frequency-dependent conductivity

values were obtained [10].

This off-ground full-waveform inversion for commercial GPR

systems was extended to invert for positive and negative gradients in

conductivity and the conductivity gradient direction could be correctly

identified [11]. Experimental specimen containing gradients were

generated by exposing a concrete slab to controlled wetting-drying cycles

using a saline solution. Full-waveform inversion of the measured data

correctly identified the conductivity gradient direction which was

confirmed by destructive analysis [11].



III. FULL-WAVEFORM INVERSION OF CROSSHOLE GPR



Using several source and receiver combinations, the area between two

boreholes can be well illuminated such that the measured data can be

used to determine the medium properties of a large number of

unknowns using gradient-based optimizations. Within the seismic

community this gradient-based full-waveform inversion has found

widespread applications [5]. In contrast, FWI methods for GPR are still

fairly new. One of the first implementations of crosshole GPR full-

waveform inversion [12] is a conjugate gradient optimization algorithm

where the gradient of the objective function is determined via an adjoint

problem based on the work of [13]. A vectorial approach was

implemented that honors the vectorial electromagnetic wave propagation

and simultaneously updates the permittivity and conductivity [14].

Nonlinearity issues that especially in high contrast media afflict the

inverse scattering problems can be avoided by starting the inversion with

only the low frequency content of the data and extending the used

bandwidth for later iterations [15]. To apply this method to experimental

data and invert the data using 2D forward model, a 3D to 2D conversion

is required and an effective source wavelet must be estimated [16]. The

starting relative permittivity and conductivity tomograms are usually

obtained using standard ray-based inversion that is using the first!

arrival times and first-cycle amplitudes.

Applying the full-waveform inversion on several crosshole GPR

data sets acquired in gravel aquifers shows that sub-wavelength

thickness low-velocity waveguiding layers can be correctly imaged [16-

17], whereas ray-based inversion techniques are not able to image these

thin waveguide layers because they only exploit the first-arrival times

and first-cycle amplitudes. Excellent fits of amplitudes and phase

between the measured and modeled data indicate the reliability of the

obtained inversion results. Converting the permittivity results into

porosity and comparing with Neutron–Neutron logging data show a good

correspondence [17].



IV. FULL-WAVEFORM INVERSION OF ON-GROUND GPR



On-ground GPR has wider radiation patterns than off-ground GPR which

enable the reconstruction of subsurface objects with higher spatial

resolution. However, a reduced coverage of the subsurface is obtained

compared to crosshole GPR such that the ill-posedness of the inverse

problem is increased. A 2D FWI of multi-offset on-ground GPR data was

recently implemented and applied on synthetic data using a quasi-

Newton optimization [18] by assuming a known source wavelet.

Whereas, for off-ground GPR, and in most cases also for crosshole GPR,

the emitted electric field can be considered relatively constant, for on-

ground GPR radiation patterns the coupling of the antennas and,

therefore, the shape and amplitude of the wavelet strongly depend on the

underlying medium [19]. Consequently, the estimation of the effective

source wavelet and, therefore, the application of the FWI are less

straightforward for experimental data. Inaccuracies in the conductivity

starting model result in erroneous effective wavelet amplitudes and

therefore in erroneous inversion results, because the conductivity and

wavelet amplitudes are coupled.

To obtain reliable inversion results, a simultaneous permittivity

and conductivity updating together with the phase and the amplitude of

the source wavelet was recently implemented using a gradient-free

combined global-local optimization approach [20] based on a frequency-

domain solution of Maxwell’s equations including far, intermediate, and

near fields assuming a 3-D layered subsurface.

Applying the on-ground full-waveform inversion over a silty loam

with significant variability in the soil texture returned quantitative

permittivity and conductivity values that are consistent with theta probe,

electromagnetic resistivity tomography, and electromagnetic induction

measurements [21]. The permittivities and conductivities increase with

increasing clay and silt and decreasing skeleton content. Moreover, with

increasing permittivities and conductivities, the wavelet center frequency

decreases, whereas the wavelet amplitude increases, which is consistent

with the radiation pattern and the antenna coupling characteristics [21].

This indicates that the wavelet center frequency and amplitude return

valuable information that can also be used for subsurface

characterization.



V. CONCLUSION



The full-waveform inversion of GPR data uses accurate forward modeling

programs, which have been recently become possible due to the

increased computation power. In this way, quantitative values for the

permittivity and conductivity structures can be obtained which goes

beyond qualitative structural characterization.

The used forward model should describe the dominant aspects

present in the electromagnetic wave propagation. Any aspect that is not

correctly described in the forward model will have an influence on the

obtained inversion results. It is therefore important to further develop

sophisticated forward modeling algorithms that are able to accurately

capture the complexity of the electromagnetic wave propagation. Also the

computational efficiency using cluster computers needs to be further

improved such that these detailed forward models can be used in

inversion algorithms where at each iteration the forward model needs to

be calculated several times.

To apply full-waveform inversion on experimental data, a good

start model should be used that already contains approximate smooth

versions of the permittivity and conductivity distributions. Such a start

model can be often obtained by ray-based methods and should be

complemented by a priory information when available. An effective

wavelet needs to be estimated that effectively describes the complicated

behavior of the source and receiver antennas by using point dipole

source and receiver antennas in the forward modeling program. In the

presence of high contrasts, the non-linearity needs to be accommodated

by using first the low-frequency information of the measured wavefield

and including higher frequency information for later iterations.

Independent measurements using CPT, borehole measurements or

coring are necessary to validate the inversion results and optimize the

inversion approach. Moreover, a multi-disciplinary approach will enable

to include knowledge into the inversion process of the material

properties of, and processes taking place in, civil engineering structures.

In this way, the full-waveform inversion enables a high resolution

subsurface characterization and can be applied to a wide range of civil

engineering applications.

Abstract



Mara Nord project was implemented during 2010-2012. It was a joint

development project between Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish GPR and

Road experts. Road authorities had an important role to define project

goals. During Mara Nord GPR training sessions were organized and GPR

knowledge distributed. Education gained a lot of popularity among road

specialists. Harmonization of Nordic GPR market was started by

recommendations for the guidelines of GPR measurements. Also quality

assurance of new asphalt pavement was researched and few development

ideas were presented. This short paper is based on material produced

during Mara Nord.



I. INTRODUCTION



When talking about the GPR application on roads the Finnish Transport

Agency has the largest experience in the Nordic countries. It was

identified that it would be beneficial to transfer the existing practices to

Swedish and Norwegian Transport Administrations and create common

Nordic Recommendations that would lead towards standardizing of GPR

services for road surveys. Mara Nord project was created to implement

these changes. The project started in January 2010 and ended in June

2012. Mara Nord was financed by EU Interreg IVA North programme. [1]

The aim of Mara Nord project was to boost the cooperation

between the Nordic Transport Administrations, research organizations

and the business sector specifically by improving the market conditions

for GPR method application in civil engineering for nondestructive

testing of roads. [1]

The project objective is reached through five main work packages:

(1) providing GPR training to road administrations (EDU1) and to

companies (EDU2), (2) creating joint Nordic Recommendations for

Finland, Sweden and Norway, (3) benchmarking different GPR systems,

(4) networking and dissemination of the results, (5) further testing of the

GPR method applicability to new asphalt pavement quality monitoring.

[1]



II. EDUCATION AND NORDIC RECOMMENDATIONS



In Mara Nord project WP1 the education in the field of GPR was provided

by training sessions. Training package 1 (EDU1) was mainly aimed to

the GPR service buyers and the training package 2 (EDU2) was aimed to

the service providers. Both training courses where held in Norway,

Sweden and Finland.

The EDU1 consisted of the GPR history, general applications,

hardware, control units and different antenna types and their

application to road surveys. It also included parts such as legislation

and licensing and traffic safety. The practical examples where given to

present the GPR data collection process and introduce the software

options for data analysis and presentation. The EDU1 was very well

attended in total educating more than hundred participants. [1]

The EDU2 was targeted especially towards the GPR service

providers so that they can provide better service and understand the

customer needs better. This training included topics such as facts to be

noticed in GPR work planning and needs of the GPR service buyers. It

also covered the topics of arranging GPR field data collection, safety

issues and combining the survey methods, data analysis methods and

interpretation techniques. It also covered important parts such as

quality assurance. Many practical examples where discussed during the

training and participants had the chance to explore GPR software and

try interpreting the data under the supervision of experts. Trainings in

EDU1 and EDU2 were held by the project consultant Roadscanners Oy.

[1]

WP2 was about writing the Nordic Recommendations. This was a

step forwards towards joined management and standardized

procurement practices of GPR surveys on roads. Meanwhile the national

standards existed in Finland similar or the same type of coordinated

procurement and service requirements did not exist either in Sweden or

Norway. It is easier for the GPR companies to compete fairly across the

Nordic borders if the rules and regulations are standardized and

implemented as jointly as possible. During the Mara Nord project five

different joint recommendations were developed to address the different

types of surveys most commonly performed on road surveys. [1] Those

recommendations are [2]-[6]:



– Use of GPR in pavement design and road rehabilitation projects

– Use of GPR in bridge applications

– Use of GPR in site investigation

– Use of GPR in road construction quality control

– Use of GPR in asphalt quality control

After the Mara Nord project Swedish Transport Administration

has started the process to prepare two method descriptions

(investigation of existing roads and quality control) based on Mara Nord

guidelines. These are meant to be as a base for a tendering process.

Norwegian Public Roads Administration has used the

recommendations directly in a tendering process for investigation of

existing roads and quality control. Experiences have been good. It has

been easier for the service providers to deliver offers and administration

to compare offers with each other.

III. BENCMARKING OF DIFFERENT GPR SYSTEMS



The aim of the WP3 was to describe different types of GPR equipment

available and their performance. The target was not to put the

equipment in any specific order, but to describe what kind of equipment

is available, how they can be used, how they perform in field work and

how the results look.

In the benchmarking of different GPR equipment the target was to

collect information on the equipment, perform measurements and make

a brief data analysis. Only the GPR manufacturers, who were interested

in this study and participated in the costs, where represented in the

tests. The units and the antennas had to be approved by ECC/ETSI. [7]

GPR manufacturers present in the test were:



– 3D-radar AS, Norway

– Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc., USA

– IDS, Italy

– Malå Geoscience, Sweden

GPR measurements were done at two sites, Talvitie Street and a

section 505 of highway 4. Both of these sites are located outside

Rovaniemi, Finland. Both sections had been rehabilitated in 2010 and

therefore the layers of the road where fresh and clear. The survey sites

were very good for GPR and all the systems worked at their best levels

concerning depth penetration and resolution. [7]

The main conclusion from the tests where that all the tested

equipment showed to be reliable and produced good quality data. All of

the achieved results showed to be good or very good. [7], [10]

GPR tests showed that in the high frequency range the horn

antennas still have advantages over ground coupled antennas at high

speed in road surveys. Also additional data can be gathered at the same

time: bouncing and dielectric value. On the other hand, when the survey

good quality data and the horizontal resolution is better than with the

horn antennas. [7], [10]



IV. QUALITY ASSURANCE OF NEW ASPHALT PAVEMENT



In 1997 Petri Roimela introduced a regression model between dielectric

value measured by GPR and void content of new asphalt pavement.

Since that time GPR have been used as a quality assurance method for

new asphalt pavements in Finland. [8], [9] In this method a continuous

void content profile of asphalt pavement is determined by GPR survey.

The determination of void content is based on the regression model

introduced by Roimela in 1997. Moreover, it requires some reference drill

cores to be taken from the pavement for calibration of the model. [1], [10]

The main objective in Work Package 5 (WP 5) of Mara Nord project

was to improve the reliability of the current void content method. First

the research focused on the examination of current regression model.

The aim was to improve the accuracy of the current regression model as

well as to find out if new models need to be used with different asphalt

types. Furthermore, the influence of environmental factors (temperature,

moisture) on GPR results was investigated. [1], [10]

Another objective in WP 5 was to investigate the possibility to

abandon asphalt core samples in calibration. The use of an asphalt

calibration plate and some NDT method (e.g. Troxler) was investigated.

After all, it was recognized that it might be impossible to abandon

asphalt core samples with the current void content method. Therefore,

another ways to access the quality of new asphalt pavement through

GPR survey was also investigated. Suggestions have been made that the

quality could be determined from the homogeneity of new asphalt

pavement. One aim in WP 5 was to define this homogeneity and how it

relates to GPR data. [1], [10]

Various laboratory measurements (GPR, Troxler, Percometer, 3D

laser, air-water weighing, environmental factors, and core samples) were

carried out with asphalt plates to validate the regression model used in

void content method. Two common asphalt types, asphalt concrete and

stone mastic asphalt, were used and the plates were made to different

compaction. Unfortunately, due to too wide variation in regression data

an accurate regression model could not be validated. [1], [10]

Field test (GPR, core samples) were done on roads 18 and 725.

The main aims of the field tests was to produce good quality GPR data

for the Mara Nord research and to test operators and their equipment in

void content measurements. The field test demonstrated that GPR has

good repeatability and reproducibility in the current void content method

used in Finland when the same reference drill cores are used. [1], [10]

As a summary of Mara Nord project WP5 findings, the

improvements of the current void content method are the following:



– More than one reference core should be taken from each reference

point location. Moreover, reference points should be placed in a

location where GPR does not detect remarkable changes in

dielectric values.

– Core samples should be taken from each survey line particularly

when asphalt mass, working method, base treatment or

environmental circumstances change.

– The possibility to place survey line between wheel paths needs to

be examined when traffic has compacted new asphalt before

quality assurance surveys.

– To avoid significant differences in dielectric value level of separate

GPR surveys metal plate measurement should be done in the

same circumstances as the survey.

– GPR operator needs to monitor GPR data to detect possible long

term changes in direct pulse amplitude. If such is found, the

changes need to be eliminated in dielectric value calculation.

Wavelet analysis gives another perspective to quality assurance of

new asphalt pavements. Wavelet analysis together with special statistical

technique can perform qualitative as well as quantitative information of

the homogeneity of asphalt pavement. The method also localizes the

significant variation in GPR survey. To utilize this method for quality

assurance the connection of significant dielectric value variation to

detected pavement damages should be investigated in long term

surveillance. [1], [10], [11]





V. CONCLUSION



GPR has been used widely in Nordic countries in road surveys. Recent

technological development has made GPR equipment to be an effective

and reliable survey method. An example is a modern full range 3D GPR

system. Also it is seen that GPR is more and more integrated with other

surveys and investigations. Traditionally GPR has been used for

determination of layer thicknesses, but there are more applications to be

discovered in the future. Evaluation of different material characteristics

is one path.

Although the future of the GPR technological development is

favorable, GPR market in Norway, Sweden and Finland are somewhat

limited and uncertain. Unfortunately because of this many GPR service

providers are reluctant to make large investments in the newest

technology. Projects like Mara Nord indicates that there are still common

interest among Nordic road authorities, service providers and GPR

manufacturers to continue develop the use of the GPR in road surveys

even further.

Mara Nord recommendations for guidelines were made to

harmonize Nordic GPR market. Road administrations have used these

guidelines as a part of the tendering process so some level of

harmonization has been accomplished. But more work need to be done

especially Europe-wide.

Also development work of new asphalt pavement quality

assurance needs to be continued. For future research Mara Nord project

recommends the following topics:

– The regression model between dielectric value and void content

should be based rather on field tests (test site or road sections)

than on laboratory test (pavement plates).

– Homogeneity is an alternative property for the void content to

indicate quality assurance of new asphalt pavement. Wavelet

analysis is one promising method to investigate asphalt pavement

homogeneity.

Long term surveillance of road sections is needed to validate

quality assurance methods. For example, in the homogeneity model

correlation between statistically significant variations with pavement

damage should be determined. Also the possibility to move from 2D to

3D quality assurance surveys should be investigated.

Abstract



A considerable number of studies about GPR applications in building

inspection can be found in the literature. These applications are mainly

focused on rebar detection and in cultural heritage evaluations.

Remarkable results can be found about cracks detection and inspection of

masonry walls and columns. It is also remarkable the development of data

processing to enhance the images and to facilitate the data interpretation.

Other special works are based on laboratory tests to determine quantitative

properties of constructive materials. Therefore, damp measures, concrete

degradation due to corrosion, and damages due to tree roots are tested in

laboratory specimens. Although it is a promising subject, few studies have

been applied in buildings.





I. INTRODUCTION



Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is frequently used in building

inspection, mainly in rebar detection (e.g., [1];[2]) and in cultural

heritage studies (e.g., [3], [4] [5]). GPR surveys use to be applied as a

support or preliminary analysis to determine characteristics that are

needed in more extensive evaluations. In these cases, GPR provides

valuable data that helps in the simulation of the building behavior or in

the selection of part of the building that require further analysis with

other methods. Consequently, precise data are usually required and,

therefore, inspection in buildings needs accurate data acquisition,

processing and interpretation.

Building inspection is performed for diverse reasons: (1) in many

cities, a periodic inspection is required in some old buildings, (2) to

conduct careful evaluations after an earthquake or other natural hazard,

(3) as a previous task in restoration of cultural heritage or special

buildings, (4) to define risk maps in cities, (5) to evaluate restorations or

changes in the structure of the building, (6) to inspect structures when

damages are detected, etc. A careful and minimally invasive inspection

use to be required in all these cases, because buildings often should be

kept in service.

Tasks for building inspection require, usually, a first visual

evaluation consisting of a visual scrutiny that provides information

about external elements and damages. This information about the

external state is used to consider the possible internal conditions and

deterioration.

The preliminary information obtained in the visual inspection can

be applied to select the most significant areas that must be evaluated

more in depth. The next inspection is often a slightly invasive evaluation,

random destructive tests are executed in selected areas. These studies

provide valuable and punctual information about the building. However,

in many cases, a more intensive scrutiny is required. Then, it is usual to

perform complementary investigation involving non-destructive testing

(NDT) techniques that supplies indirect information about the internal

elements of the structure.

Ground-Penetrating Radar is one of the most usual NDT methods

in buildings inspection because of the low cost and on the expeditious

data acquisition, although in many cases this technique is applied

combined with other inspection methods. GPR survey is an especially

attractive technique in cultural heritage inspection, where noninvasive

evaluations is required. Examples as [3]-[7] highlight the importance of

historical buildings radar explorations. Other proposed GPR applications

are in the inspection of modern buildings that are reaching a critical age

[8].

The great differences in structural solutions, as well as the

different requirements depending on the projects, yield to many different

strategies and solutions and, in many cases, the potential of the method

is still being verified, mostly in experimental laboratory tests or in

simulations.



II. TYPES OF BUILDINGS



A great number of applications related to buildings are referred to

cultural heritage. These buildings are often masonry structures. Stone

and brick walls are the most studied parts of these structures. However,

in some cases, these buildings are combined structures as a result of

later reconstructions. Then, modern constructive elements coexists with

ancient masonry ones. In some cases, the evaluation of reconstructed

buildings involves the detection of the contacts between old and modern

parts [9], the detection of metallic connecting elements between the

structures of different epochs, or the confirmation of the existence of old

remains under less ancient elements [10].

Other common types of buildings which can be studied by means

of GPR are modern concrete structures. In these cases, common

applications are the detection of rebar, damages, or beams under

enclosures.

GPR applications in wooden buildings are unusual, however in

many cases the buildings include structural wood elements. Many

masonry buildings have wooden beams or wood supports. The

deterioration of these timber elements occurs generally by dampness,

woodworms and fungi. In the few studies on this subject [11], [12], the

importance of combining different non-invasive techniques is

highlighted, to define clearly the cause of the anomalies and the

resistant characteristics of the wooden elements.



III. APPLICATION IN BUILDING DIAGNOSIS: DETECTION OF DAMAGES



Landslides, earthquakes and the age of the buildings are usual causes

for diagnosis studies. Recent earthquakes have emphasized the

%

importance of detailed assessments of the impaired buildings, prior its

rehabilitation. Several proposals of diagnosis procedures include GPR as

a supporting methodology, being applied in different cases [13]-[15].

Other common causes are the restoration projects in cultural heritage

buildings and the appearance of visible damage to the structure or

cladding, such as damp patches, cracking and detachment of materials.

As a combined methodology usually appropriate to detect

damages, in many cases, GPR is applied to detect internal cracks and

unfilled joints in masonry buildings [16], [17]. It is common to evaluate

walls and, in some cases, other supporting structures, as columns [18],

[19]. In several cases, suggestive applications reveals the correlation

between GPR depth slices and anomalies observed visually [20].

Interesting works shows the potential of GPR by means of simulation

models and laboratory tests [21]. Several ongoing research projects are

focused on the development of new processing methodologies and

strategies to obtain satisfactory results in the study of masonry

damages, with promising results. These projects lead to a methodological

approach for the detection of multiple defects inside dielectric or

conductive media [22], [23]. In other cases, effectiveness of processing

techniques is evaluated, focusing on obtaining qualitative imaging of

damages due to cracks. Advances to define crack shape and position are

presented in different works; in [24] the possibility of using a microwave

approach based on a genetic algorithm is presented, to detect defects

inside a known host object.

In concrete reinforced buildings damages could be caused by steel

corrosion. Several researches propose the application of GPR to detect

this kind of damage. The content of ions in the porous water produces

alteration in parts of the structure affected by corrosion. Therefore, the

electromagnetic properties are modified, enabling the detection due to

differences in travel times, amplitudes and peak frequencies [8], [25].

Other usual application is the detection of parts of the structure

affected by humidity. Remarkable applications are developed in

buildings [2], [26], [27], being one of the objectives the study the

humidity in walls or in the floor. Analogous methodologies are also

successfully applied to other different kind of structures such as bridges

[28], [29] and towers [30], obtaining similar results.

GPR was also applied to determine the concrete degradation in a

factory floor, demonstrating that changes in concrete conditions could

be clearly detected [31].



IV. DETECTION OF INTERNAL ELEMENTS



Another common application of GPR in buildings is the detection of

internal elements. Rebar, reinforcements, changes in constructive

materials or embedded elements use to be the most common targets

detected with GPR [4], [32]-[35]. In other cases, this geophysical method

is applied in order to detect older constructions or constructive elements

inside the walls or under the actual building structure [26], [36], [37]. In

many cases, B-scans are used to infer the existence of hidden elements,

but currently are more habitual 3D images and time slices, which make

available tridimensional patterns of the embedded structures.



V. FOUNDATIONS AND GROUND



The study of the ground and the building foundations is also a task in

several geophysical explorations of buildings. The aim of studying the

ground under and around the building is, frequently, the detection of

geological structures that could cause damages or failure of the building

[36], [38], [39] to detect man-made structures that could affect the safety

of the structure [4], [37], or to detect wet areas, as the cause of damp

damages [2], [40]. GPR was also proposed to study the ground because

of root damages in buildings [41]. However, in these evaluations it is

usual to apply combined methodologies, being resistivity surveys the

most common techniques combined with GPR, even in some cases,

seismic surveys are also shared with GPR and resistivity, showing

promising results.

Few GPR applications cover the evaluation of foundations,

perhaps due to the difficult in the access, an important limit in GPR

surveys. Examples of these kind of applications can be found in [42] and

in [43]. Detection of foundations of archaeological remains in urban

environments (e.g., [44]) is a more common application. In these cases,

integrated studies and combined methodologies – usually GPR and

resistivity techniques – are the most usual surveys.



VI. METHODOLOGIES



Radar data acquisition methodologies depend greatly on the building

element being studied. In many evaluations, ground, walls and floor are

scrutinized to detect buried elements or zones affected by water or

cracks. In these cases, single radar lines use to be the most habitual

data acquisition method, and many examples show valuable results

(e.g., [2]-[5]).

Depending on the dimensions of the building, parallel radar

profiles could be also used to obtain three dimensional radar images of

floors and walls, providing good visualization of cracks [20], of changes

in materials [45] and of the internal elements such as rebar [46]. In

some cases, the authors discuss about the density of the grid to obtain

better images [47] by using a single antenna. Even in occasions it is

possible to utilize an array of antennas, it is not the most usual case

inside building evaluations because of the dimensions of the arrays.

Other authors propose the tomography as a proper methodology

to detect embedded objects within walls, showing impressive results and

even detecting wooden beams and polystyrene bodies inside masonry

[32].

Combined evaluations by using other geophysical techniques are

also a good option proposed and used by different authors in the search

of underneath remains under the building or in the ground evaluation to

determine the cause of building damages. The methods used most often,

combined with GPR are resistivity surveys [48]. In some cases, other

additional geophysical techniques are used together with these two

methods. It is possible to find works where GPR and resistivity are

applied jointly with very low frequency electromagnetic technique (e.g.,

[49]), and seismic methods (e.g., [36]) or ultrasonic methods (e.g., [50]).

VII. NEW AND EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENTS



Instead detection of structural elements is a regular task, the challenge

of know detailed characteristics about structural materials force to

laboratory experiments, synthetic models and new processing

methodologies. Several applications highlight the difficulties in the

buildings evaluations.

One of the problems is the confuse images produced by the non-

homogeneous structures, due to the scattering in multiple and different

targets. Reconstruction of the shapes of the scatterers is, in many cases,

a complex task. Development and evaluation of numerical methodologies

that facilitates pattern reconstruction [51]-[54] is an interesting working

line that could get an effective improvement of the results and

interpretations of GPR data from surveys in buildings. Synthetic and

experimental data have been used to evaluate the new processing

techniques, obtaining in many cases better or equivalent resolution and

a non-negligible improvement of results [51].

Software tools used in pattern reconstruction could be applied to

the detection of cracks and structural damages in different parts of the

buildings and, in many cases, focused to the detection and

reconstruction of internal cracks and damages [22], [23], [55] and on the

detection of its position and its orientation [56].

Calibration of the GPR ability to determine thicknesses and the

resolution is another interesting line of study partially applied in

building studies. In some cases, GPR data is compared to laser-scanning

results during the study of stone masonry walls [57]. In other cases,

experimental controlled tests are in quasi homogeneous media are the

tool to determine GPR resolution to detect embedded targets [58], [59].

Laboratory tests provide significant results that help in the

interpretation of radar images from applied cases in buildings. Some

experiences try to obtain accurate methodologies for the detection of

voids, combining GPR with other techniques like thermography [60] or

capacitive techniques [61].

However, some of the most interesting experimental measures

under controlled conditions are focused to establish methods to measure

properties of the constructive materials. The knowledge of these

properties could be crucial in building assessment. Remarkable

laboratory analysis are focused on the characterization of the

electromagnetic concrete properties [8], [32], [62], [63], on the detection

of steel corrosion [25], [64], [65], and on the detection of moisture [66]-

[68].



VIII. CONCLUSION



The review of the GPR applications in buildings inspection shows that

this method is widely used in building inspection to evaluate damages

and to detect embedded targets. The greatest number of applications is

done in cultural heritage buildings and, usually, combined with other

geophysical techniques. In many cases, radar data is used as

complimentary information to decide wider and more extensive studies.

In other cases, radar data assessment is required as a preliminary

evaluation in damaged buildings after natural hazards as earthquakes or

landslides.

Some cases studies are done in concrete buildings, to detect rebar

and to determine the zones probably affected by damp.

Therefore, the most common applications are realized on masonry

and concrete structures. Few applications can be found in wood

structures, although GPR is sometimes used to determine the existence

of wooden beams or structural elements in masonry buildings.

However, these applications provide always qualitative results. In

an effort to determine possible quantitative data, laboratory experiences

under controlled conditions have been developed, obtaining interesting

results. Regardless, few applications exist in buildings to determine

quantitative results, perhaps due to the inherent complexity of the

studied structures, being one of the open issues in the study of

buildings.

The noticeable advances in data processing, in pattern

reconstruction and in the acquisition data technologies have facilitated

the application of GPR in different problems associated to building

inspection.

Several open issues could be: (1) to define the casuistic in

buildings and to propose suitable radar data acquisition procedures in

each case or problem; (2) to enhance GPR imaging; (3) to apply in

different buildings those methods evaluated under laboratory test, to

determine electromagnetic parameters of the buildings materials; (4) to

enhance the radar equipments adapting the antennas to the different

structural elements and spaces inside buildings. Probably more open

issues will be defined during the tasks development of the working

group. Perhaps it could be suitable to establish a catalog of projects and

significant publications related with this subject, shared with all

participants in this project.

Abstract



The note is focused on the characterization of scope of the research

interests in project 2.4. The basic information about participants, topic list

and the suggested beginning activities was provided. The examples of

some current researches related to the Project were shortly outlined.



I. Basic information



The project 2.4 currently has 24 participants from 9 countries (Belgium,

Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain). Two

new participants declared willingness to take part in the project.



II.

Scope of the project



The project will be dedicated to a wide area of problems related to

material properties determination in GPR inspection practice.

The beginning suggestion was to omit problems related to

structural studies of constructions, as construction structures usually

belong to buildings (P2.2) and transport infrastructure (P2.3). But there

are some suggestions to include structural studies related to exceptional

constructions which do not belong clearly to these two categories (like

retaining walls). The quality/damage characteristics (like cracks and

delaminations) will be treated, as well. The review chapter [1] is being

prepared.

III.

List of topics



The following list of topics was created as a result of consultations and

with the help of the WG2 projects leaders; its form is enough wide and

elastic to cover the extensions suggested during discussions:



1) List of the most important construction materials and pre-cast

structures:

• Characterisation of material properties being investigated

• Major measuring and interpretation problems

2) List of laboratory methods, which have practical use in direct

determination of permittivity on technical samples/mixings:

• Standard equipment

• Convenient laboratory settings

3) List of methods for determination of the near-surface permittivity:

• Test scenarios, settings and configuration of the measuring

systems

• Pre-processing and signal interpretation issues

4) List of GPR techniques for the estimation of EM properties and

characterisation of material structural condition:

• Test scenarios, settings and configuration of the measuring

systems

• Pre-processing and signal interpretation issues

5) List of the field and laboratory test sites, where calibration and

comparative measurements (reflection amplitude, permittivity, layer

velocity, monitoring sensors installed: humidity/temperature...) can

be performed on large samples or on real constructions.



IV.

Suggested questionnaire



A special questionnaire dedicated to project 2.4 is suggested to allow

exchange of information as to the possibilities of tests on large samples

(properties determination and laboratory structural modeling, Fig. 1) and

laboratory techniques for the determination of the EM properties. This

area has crucial importance for practical activity.

“EVALUATION OF MOISTURE CONTENT USING GPR”

(CONTRIBUTION TO PROJECT 2.5)

Abstract

This study deals with the evaluation of moisture content of concrete using

electromagnetic techniques (permittivity measurement using weak

perturbation method at 1.26 GHz and GPR technique at 1.5 GHz). The

results show good correlation between concrete permittivity, GPR amplitude

and moisture content.



I. INTRODUCTION



Water ingress through concrete pores is considered among the major

causes of physicochemical pathologies, and the risk of damage is related

to the degree of saturation or the moisture content (1). For example, a

relative humidity value of approximately 65% is optimal for carbonation

to proceed (2). Chlorides diffuse through water in the pores (3). The

expansion of concrete associated with alkali-aggregate reaction is

significant when the water content by weight of concrete exceeds

approximately 4% (4). Freezing-and-thawing cycles present a risk of

damage above a critical degree of saturation of approximately 0.8 for

non-air-entrained concrete (5). Therefore, knowledge of the moisture

variation in concrete structures is critical for predicting pathological

risks at early stages of deterioration.

Traditional methods aiming to assess the condition of structures,

such as electrical resistivity measurement or half-cell potential test, are

slow and require lane closures for the sounding of bridge decks. In

contrast, GPR measurement is a potentially powerful technique because

it is a non-destructive method, relatively insensitive to ambient

conditions, and it can investigate large surfaces in a relatively short

time. Many researchers have emphasized the capability of GPR

technology to evaluate the rate of degradation of reinforced concrete

structures (6-8). Such work, however, generally focuses on the

assessment of damage or deterioration, which has developed over time,

such as delamination or cracks mainly caused by the progression of

physicochemical pathologies. According to many studies, the

propagation of GPR waves is affected by the presence of water in

concrete (9,12). Therefore, analyses of the recorded GPR signals can

provide quantitative information on the moisture of concrete. In

addition, it is also important to study the effect of moisture and concrete

type on the variation of concrete permittivity that governs the

propagation of GPR waves.



II. EXPERIMENTS



The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of the degree of

saturation, water-cement ratio (w/c), and volumetric water content on

the permittivity and the GPR features (amplitude variation of direct and

reflected waves). Permittivity measurements were undertaken using a

weak perturbation method at 1.26 GHz, which is close to the frequency

of the used GPR antennas (1.5 GHz). The behaviour of the permittivity

variation with respect to moisture was also modelled using analytical

mixing models (CRIM, De Loor and Debye) [9].



III. RESULTS



Test results show that an increase in the degree of saturation leads to

significant increase in both real and imaginary part of the permittivity.

The analytical models such as CRIM and De Loor fit well the real part

(Fig 1). However, the imaginary part of the permittivity is not well

evaluated using the De Loor model but the CRIM simulations are in good

agreement with the experimental results.

Regarding GPR signal (Fig 3), the moisture decreases the

amplitude of the direct wave. This is mainly attributed to the increase in

complex permittivity related to the polarization and conduction

mechanisms occurring in concrete. Generally, the GPR measurements

showed good repeatability, which was evaluated using the coefficient of

variation, and the statistical dispersion of the direct wave amplitude was

lower than that of the reflected wave.

For dry and wet concrete, w/c did not appear as an influent

parameter regarding the experimental results. A good correlation was

found between the amplitude of direct wave for each degree of saturation

(Fig 4). Irrespectively of w/c and the depth of reflector, an empirical

relationship between signal amplitude of direct wave and volumetric

water content was established that could be used to estimate concrete

moisture.

In Northern countries long and cold winter causes snow and frost. Snow

cover protects the subsurface frost penetration but the snowmelt as well

as the melting frost cause problems. Snow thawing causes flood and

over saturates the subsurface while soil freezing and melting cause frost

damages.

Radar antennas of several GHz has been used for automatic

monitoring of snow thickness, but the prediction of snow water content

and the date and duration of melting. In our study we used 1 GHz

antenna and SIR3000 GPR (GSSI) to monitor snow thickness, snow

water content and soil surface wetness. We standardized antenna

position at 1.3 m over the ground surface, hence the time differences of

ground pulse are related to the amount of snow, the mixture of air and

ice. Because our aim was to automatize the interpretation of surface

signals the zero point of scan, measuring time and the number of

samples of a scan were standardized to keep the surface signal locations

sub-constant. Filtters and gains were locked to notice changes in ground

surface pulse amplitude. An automatic soil water content (Campbell

Scientific CS616) and temperature (T107) monitoring station was

established as a reference for the ground pulse amplitude

measurements.

The repeatability of GPR pulses was excellent, but we found the

pulse of snow surface difficult to interpret. Amplitude of the ground

pulse was not only proportional to the changes in soil water but also the

unfrozen water content in the snow cover. During the period no thawing

there was a good linear relationship between the ground pulse travel

time and snow water content but the results differed in case of unfrozen

water in snow.

Because of the excellent repeatability we decided to try GPR with

400 MHz antenna in frost monitoring on sub-urban road. Two 100 m

long lines were marked at 5 m interval and the GPR background profiles

and a soil water content and temperature monitoring station were done

at the time with no frost. From January to April the profiling was

repeated 8 times. It became evident that it is possible to follow the frost

penetration and melting cycle by GPR, but interpretation of freezing front

is unreliable without no-frost background profile.

“GPR EXPERIENCE AT THE NATIONAL LABORATORY FOR CIVIL ENGINEERING,

LISBON, PORTUGAL”



Simona Fontul

Transportation Department, National Laboratory for Civil

Engineering, Av. do Brasil, 101, 1700-066 Lisbon, Portugal

simona@lnec.pt





This report presents the experience gathered at National Laboratory for

Civil Engineering, Portugal. The main experience is on road and airfield

pavement evaluation, since 1998, namely the layer thickness

measurement. In the last two years, research has been done in the

railway evaluation using GPR.

Two different research areas are addressed, the GPR testing and

the joint interpretation of GPR with other non-destructive tests, such as

Falling Weight Deflectometer.

A selection of case studies of GPR application is presented and

some of the main lessons learnt from the experience are referred. The

specific conditions for GPR measurements in each of these cases are

briefly presented and the results are analysed. Both flexible and rigid

pavements were studied, new and overlaid, including one case of

concrete reinforced pavement of a runway.

In the last year, laboratory tests were performed on railway

ballast, with different GPR antennas, in order to study the sensitivity of

the dielectric constant with different water contents and ballast fouling

levels. The main results obtained and the validation with some in situ

tests, are also presented herein.

Research has been done in joint interpretation of GPR and FWD

for bearing capacity evaluation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) tool was

used to improve the backanalysis of flexible pavements.

Another ongoing research at LNEC is the interpretation of GPR

tests performed on railway together with rail geometry parameters, in

order to improve the monitoring and to support the maintenance

decisions.

Also, LNEC is participating in the European project Tomorrow’s

Road Infrastructure Monitoring and Management (TRIMM). This project

intents to contribute to the improvement of pavement’s structural

evaluation with new monitoring techniques, in order to take full

advantage of the monitoring systems and integrate this information on

the pavement management systems. LNEC is involved in the

improvement of GPR for pavement monitoring at traffic speed,

CORELESS GPR, namely an approach of using combined antennas

measurements to evaluate the pavement without coring.

“GPR ACTIVITIES AT THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE FOR MATERIALS RESEARCH

AND TESTING (BAM), IN GERMANY”



Christiane Trela, BAM, Berlin, Germany

christiane.trela@bam.de



In this contribution, the GPR activities in the field of civil engineering

(CE) of the division 8.2 “Non-Destructive Damage Assessment and

Environmental Measurement Methods” in the Federal Institute for

Materials Research and Testing (BAM) are presented.

BAM is a technical and scientific federal authority belonging to

the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in Berlin /

Germany. Its research focuses on safety aspects of energy supply and

environmental protection as well as on materials engineering and related

technologies. In this frame, new analysis and testing methods are

developed and evaluated. GPR is used here as a nondestructive method

(NDT) to carry out structural investigations and material tests at

building components from the construction industry.

The contribution covers the following topics regarding the GPR

application in CE:

•

Topics of research and work activities

•

GPR equipment and available testing facilities

•

Testing opportunities

•

GPR examples of laboratory work and case studies

•

Ongoing projects.

Topics of research and work activities are summarized in the

slides [3] to [17].

The members of our radar group are usually solving tasks, which

were given by the construction industry, where GPR equipment is used.

This includes also assessing the quality of the results.

For this purpose, typically the following work packages are

agreed:

•

Construction of test specimen

•

Test of efficient measurement setups

•

Simulation of wave propagation

•

Optimization of data analysis and validation

•

Presentation of results for non-specialists.

The variety of materials and structural elements, from which the

test specimens were built was presented, including an overview about

the situation in the laboratory and the environmental conditions under

which they were used, see slide [4].

The slides [5] and [6] show the characteristic parameters which

can be changed in a GPR measurement setups. An example from

practice shows how the settings such as alignment and spacing of the

measurement profiles etc. are selected, starting from the task to detect

shear needles and tendon ducts behind reinforcement in a concrete

structure.

FD modeling is often carried out for supporting the construction

of test specimens and to evaluate the GPR measurements.

The slides [8] to [12] show evaluation methods and examples to

optimize data analysis and validation. This includes important data

processing steps such as filtering algorithms and image enhancement

through migration with 3D SAFT reconstruction. Other nondestructive

testing methods (NDT) like ultrasonic or X-Ray are used for validation

purposes. To determine the reliability of qualitative testing tasks the

POD analysis (Probability of Detection) was presented in more detail

using the example of the determination of the detection depth of rebars

in concrete slabs.

Finally, an important focus is set on the way of presenting the

results to the clients who are usually no GPR specialists. Plots of isolines

are often a good representation.

An important issue of our work is the automation of

measurements. For this purpose scanner systems have been built and

adapted for a variety of practical applications and we have gained a lot of

experience in this field. We have been carrying out investigations at

many different buildings, such as bridges, roads, foundations and can

report about many successful measurements.

In order to convey this knowledge about the proper and

successful use of GPR in CE, the participation in committees as well as

the essential training and development of employees is an important

activity, we are seriously pursuing at BAM.

GPR equipment and available testing facilities are presented on

the slides [18] and [19], reference is being made here again on slide [14],

where different scanner systems are shown. Particular attention is given

to the latest generation of scanners for GPR implementations, which

allow significantly improved measurements.

The testing opportunities are briefly discussed on slide [20]. In

addition to various laboratory tests at custom-made test specimen, field

measurements at large and close-to-reality objects are possible on the

large test site near Berlin.

Examples of laboratory work and case studies of our GPR

activities are presented on slides [21] to [25]. Typical examples were

presented at reinforced concrete. The tests can be grouped into the

following three areas:

•

Localization of post-tensioning reinforcement

•

Quality control of precast concrete wall elements

•

Proof of reinforcement mesh density in a concrete floor.

A case study for accurate localization of reinforcement has been

presented in more detail on slides [22] to [25]. For the upgrading of

bridges, the customer often requires the information about precise

positions for damage free core drilling. This is important for the

strengthening of the structure without destroying or harming the inner

parts, while drilling. In preliminary studies, the GPR equipment is tested

and the measurement settings are optimized for the specific testing

tasks. Based on many years of experience in this field we are able to

propose an optimized inspection procedure.

At the end of the presentation two ongoing projects were

presented on slides [26] and [27]. One of them is a thesis that shows

how corrosion of rebars in concrete in a GPR monitoring experiment can

be represented via frequency mapping. The second is a research project

to detect weak scatterers like honeycombs behind reinforcement with

systematic studies in reflection and transmission mode.

“GPR ACTIVITIES FOR ROAD APPLICATIONS

AT THE BRRC, IN BELGIUM”



Colette Grégoire, Carl Van Geem

Belgian Road Research Centre

c.gregoire@brrc.be, c.vangeem@brrc.be



The Belgian Road Research Centre (BRRC) is often asked to evaluate the

road structure with deflections measurements, the origin of road

damages, the origin of collapse, the risk of instability of concrete slabs,

the detection of cables or pipes before works, and so on.

To complete and improve the inverse calculation performed on the

deflections and in order to map some features in the road structures, the

BRRC bought a radar, which is a well-known geophysical technique

used in road investigation. The BRRC acquired a GPR acquisition system

(SIR 20, GSSI) and 2 horn antennas (1 GHz and 2 GHz) in 2010.

We used the radar in different projects. In some cases, the use of

radar bought some advantages. We were able to determine the thickness

of asphalt layer or concrete layer useful for backcalculation, visualize the

layer thickness changes and the variations in the road structures. In

other cases, the use of radar was not so successful. We were not able to

detect holes under the concrete slabs or loss between asphalt layers.

Due to the lack of existing methodologies and the remaining

questions concerning the use of radar for road investigations, the

Belgian Road Research Centre started in November 2013 a research

project in partnership with ‘Institut Scientifique de Service Public’. This

project aims at the establishment of standard methodologies for

acquisition, processing and interpretation of radar measurements that

are specific for road investigation. The aspects concerned by this project

are the determination of homogeneous zones in the road structure, the

estimation of the thickness of the different layers and the possibility to

evaluate material quantities and properties in order to recycle most of

them and in order to better define the appropriated dismantling

technique.

In order to calibrate the radar equipment and to perform

measurements in well controlled conditions, the first action in the frame

of the project is the construction of a test site in the hall of BRRC. On

this test site 4 different road configurations are built (asphalt layer on

concrete plates, asphalt layer on lean concrete, concrete layer on lean

concrete separated by a thin layer asphalt and asphalt covering

cobblestone). An unbound aggregate layer serves as a base layer.

Heterogeneities (holes, voids, pipes, …) are buried in the structure. The

site will be instrumented with temperature and strain gauges. Also

deflection measurements using a falling weight deflectometer will be

performed on a regular basis on this test site. The building of the test

site started in January.

Some results related to previous projects will be presented and we

will present the above mentioned recently started research project.

AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM FOR GPR SURVEYING OF PAVEMENT,

BRIDGES AND TUNNELS



Roger Wisén, Jørgen Ringgaard

Department of Geophysics and Geohydrology,

Ramboll Denmark A/S,

Hannemanns allé 63, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark

rgw@ramboll.dk



This contribution is intended to give a brief introduction to a system for

efficient 3D GPR surveying conducted by Rambøll in Denmark.

The system is built up of 3 basic parts: a GPR monitoring system;

a high accuracy GNSS positioning system; and a navigational software.

The system can be placed on any type of bearer from a man

carrying a light GPR monitoring system to a heavy vehicle for work in

difficult terrain or traffic.

Examples of surveys performed by Rambøll are: mapping peat

bogs on frozen ground in the north utilizing a dual channel 2D GPR

ProEx monitoring system from Malå Geoscience; mapping of pavement

and utilities on roads and airports utilizing a Geoscope Mk IV and a

1.8m DX antenna from 3D-radar; mapping of void behind cast concrete

tunnel liners utilizing a Geoscope Mk IV and a 1.2m VX antenna from

3D-radar, in this example the GNSS system was replaced with a fixed

height mounting and an odometer for precise inline positioning.

COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology is an intergovernmental

framework aimed at facilitating the collaboration and networking of scientists

and researchers at European level. It was established in 1971 by 19 member

countries and currently includes 35 member countries across Europe, and Israel

as a cooperating state.

COST funds pan-European, bottom-up networks of scientists and researchers

across all science and technology fields. These networks, called 'COST Actions',

promote international coordination of nationally-funded research. By fostering

the networking of researchers at an international level, COST enables break-

through scientific developments leading to new concepts and products, thereby

contributing to strengthening Europe’s research and innovation capacities.

COST’s mission focuses in particular on: building capacity by connecting high

quality scientific communities throughout Europe and worldwide; providing

networking opportunities for early career investigators; increasing the impact of

research on policy makers, regulatory bodies and national decision makers as

well as the private sector.

Through its inclusiveness, COST supports the integration of research

communities, leverages national research investments and addresses issues of

global relevance. Every year thousands of European scientists benefit from being

involved in COST Actions, allowing the pooling of national research funding to

achieve common goals.

As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST anticipates and

complements the activities of EU Framework Programmes, constituting a “bridge”

towards the scientific communities of emerging countries. In particular, COST

Actions are also open to participation by non-European scientists coming from

neighbour countries (for example Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,

Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, the

Palestinian Authority, Russia, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine) and from a number of

international partner countries.

COST's budget for networking activities has traditionally been provided by

successive EU RTD Framework Programmes. COST is currently executed by the

European Science Foundation (ESF) through the COST Office on a mandate by

the European Commission, and the framework is governed by a Committee of

Senior Officials (CSO) representing all its 35 member countries.

More information about COST is available at www.cost.eu.



The scientific activities of the COST Action TU1208 are carried out within

four Working Groups (WGs). The effectiveness of this scheme will be checked

after the first year of activities and will eventually be modified, considering the

actual number of active participants in each WG. The structure of each WG

will always be kept as flexible as possible, in order to enable new participants

to join. All the participants, when joining the Action, are invited to provide

basic information on their experience, interests, and current research projects,

as well as WGs and Projects preferences. Each participant can belong to two

WGs and an arbitrary number of projects within the chosen WGs.

The four TU1208 WGs are: WG1 – Novel GPR instrumentation; WG2 – GPR

surveying of pavements, bridges, tunnels and buildings; underground utility

and void sensing; WG3 – EM methods for near-field scattering problems by

buried structures and data processing techniques; WG4 – Different

applications of GPR and other NDT technologies in civil engineering. The WG

meetings constitute an opportunity to present activities, results and plans for

the future. Between meetings, the WG members regularly interact.
