PREFACE
SHORT-TERM SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS AND TRAINING SCHOOLS: YEAR 1

COST ACTION TU1208
“CIVIL ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR”
Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs) and Training Schools (TSs)
are among the most interesting networking tools supported by
COST (European COoperation in Science and Technology). During
Year 1 of the COST Action TU1208, four STSMs were funded and
fruitfully carried out. Furthermore, two TSs were organised and
successfully held. This book includes reports resuming these
research and didactic activities.
STSMs are aimed at supporting individual mobility of
European researchers, strengthening networks and fostering
collaborations. They allow scientists to visit an institution or
laboratory in a COST Country participating to the Action, or in an
approved Near Neighbour Country (NNC) institution, or else in an
approved International Partner Country (IPC) institution. STSMs
shall specifically contribute to the scientific objectives of the Action
offering the grant, at the same time allowing the visiting scientists
to learn new techniques or gain access to specific instruments
and/or methods not available in their own institutions.
STSM proposals have to be submitted by using the online
application form, available at https://e-services.cost.eu/stsm. The
Management Committee (MC) of the Action providing the grant
performs their evaluation. The MC of the Action TU1208 formally
delegated the evaluation of STSM applications to the Action Chair
and STSM Manager. The selection of applicants is based on the
scientific scope of the STSM application, which must be in line
with the Action objectives, and on the applicant curriculum vitae.
Geographical and gender balance issues are taken into
consideration as well. STSM applicants must be engaged in a
research programme as a postgraduate student or postdoctoral
fellow, or be employed by or officially affiliated to an institution or

legal entity. This institution is considered as the Home institution.
Institutions may be public or private entities.
Standard STSMs may have a minimum duration of 5 days
and a maximum duration of 90 days. They need to be carried out
in their entirety within a single grant period and within the
Action’s lifetime. Early-Stage Researchers (ESRs) may extend the
duration of the STSM beyond the 90 days in well-justified cases
(the maximum allowed duration is 180 days).
The participation of ESRs in STSMs is strongly encouraged.
For COST, the definition of ESR is based on the time that elapses
between the date of the PhD (or equivalent experience) and the
date of involvement in a COST Action. If this time span is less than
eight years, a person fits the definition; periods of career’s leave
have to be added to the mentioned time span. Supporting ESRs to
develop independent careers and to establish their first research
group under their own responsibility is a strategic priority for
COST.
A STSM grant is a fixed financial contribution, based on the
budget requested by the applicant and on the evaluation of the
application by the MC Chair and STSM Manager. The aim of the
grant is to support the costs associated with the exchange visit. It
does not necessarily cover all expenses and has to be intended as
a contribution to the travel and subsistence costs of the
participant.
During Year 1 of the COST Action TU1208, 100% of the
scientists who received STSM grants were ESRs or PhD Students
and perfect gender balance was achieved. The list of funded
STSMs is reported in the following:

TSs aim at widening, broadening and sharing knowledge
relevant to the Action’s objectives, through the delivery of intensive
training on a new and emerging subject. They can offer
familiarisation with unique equipment or expertise that are
typically to the benefit of ESR, although not exclusively.
COST financial support covers the organisation costs of TSs,
as well as the participation of Trainees (by assigning grants) and
Trainers (by reimbursing travel, accommodation and meal
expenses). During Year 1 of the Action TU1208, 100% of the
scientists who received TS Grants were ESRs or PhD Students,
with a perfect gender balance among them.

The first TS organised by the COST Action TU1208 focused
on “Microwave Imaging and Diagnostics: Theory, Techniques,
Applications.” It was held in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, on
March 24-28, 2014. It was a joint initiative of the Action TU1208,
the Action TD1301 “Development of a European-based
Collaborative Network to Accelerate Technological, Clinical and
Commercialisation Progress in the Area of Medical Microwave
Imaging,” and the European School of Antennas (ESoA).
Coordinators of the School were Prof Andrea Massa (IT) and Prof
Tommaso Isernia (IT).
The second TS covered the state of the art and new trends
on radar technologies: “Future Radar Systems: Radar2020.” It was
held in the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in Karlsruhe,
Germany, on May 5-9, 2014. This course was co-organised by the
Action TU1208, the ESoA, and the European Microwave
Association (EuMA). The Coordinator was Prof Werner Wiesbeck
(DE).
We are deeply grateful to COST, for funding the Action
TU1208 “Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating
Radar,” the research and training activities presented here, and
the publication of this book.

STSM 1
ELECTROMAGNETIC MODELLING
OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR RESPONSES TO COMPLEX TARGETS
Visiting ESR: Dr Lara Pajewski, “Roma Tre” University,
Engineering Department, Rome, Italy (lara.pajewski@uniroma3.it)
Host: Prof Antonios Giannopoulos, The University of Edinburgh,
School of Engineering, Edinburgh, United Kingdom
STSM Dates: 21 October 2013 – 20 December 2013
1. PURPOSE OF THE STSM

This STSM focused on the electromagnetic modelling of composite
structures for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) applications, with
the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique. The main
steps and achieved objectives of the STSM were:
1. Studying the FDTD technique and learning how to use
the freeware tool GprMax, developed by Prof Antonios
Giannopoulos.
2. Developing MATLAB procedures for the processing and
visualization of GprMax output data. Such procedures are
now available on the website of COST Action TU1208 for
free public download.
3. Defining a set of test scenarios, to be used by research
groups involved in the Working Group 3 of COST Action
TU1208, to test and compare different electromagnetic
forward- and inverse-scattering methods.
4. Modelling the test scenarios defined in 3 with GprMax.
An additional objective of the STSM was that of interacting
with the Chair of COST Action TU1206, Dr Seumas Campbell,
British Geological Survey, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, in order to
find out topics of common interest and possible synergies between
Actions TU1206 and TU1208.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM
AND OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED

2.1: THE FDTD TECHNIQUE AND GPRMAX
In order to predict correctly the GPR response from a particular
scenario, Maxwell's equations have to be solved, subject to the
physical and geometrical properties of the considered problem and
to its initial conditions. Several techniques have been developed in
computational electromagnetics, for the solution of Maxwell’s
equations. These methods can be classified into two main
categories: differential and integral equation solvers, which can be
implemented in the time or frequency domain. The differential
solvers include the FDTD and Finite-Volume Time-Domain (FVTD)
techniques, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Transmission
Line Method (TLM). The Method of Moments (MoM), instead, is an
integral equation method. All of the different techniques present
compromises between computational efficiency, stability, and the
ability to model complex geometries. The FDTD presents several
advantages: it has inherent simplicity, efficiency and conditional
stability; it is highly versatile; it has become a mature and wellresearched technique.
GprMax [1] is a well-known and largely validated FDTD
simulator, developed by Prof. Antonios Giannopoulos and available
for free public download on www.GprMax.com, along with a
detailed user guide.
The first part of the STSM was devoted to studying the FDTD
technique and to learning how to use GprMax. There is a very
large amount of information on the FDTD available in the
literature; good starting points are [2]-[4], whereas the specific
application of FDTD to the GPR forward scattering problem is
described in [5]. The GprMax user guide describes the installation
of GprMax2D and GprMax3D simulators and the various
commands which are available for the construction of 2D and 3D
GPR models; it provides some examples, to illustrate the
procedures that should be followed in order to obtain useful

"

models employing GprMax2D/3D; it includes useful hints and
tips, explaining the most fundamental aspects of using an FDTDbased program and how to avoid the most common errors.
2.2: MATLAB PROCEDURES
FOR THE PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION OF GPRMAX OUTPUT DATA
On the GprMax website, some MATLAB functions are available for
free download: they can be used to import in MATLAB the
GprMax2D/3D output data, stored in binary format, in order to
process and visualize them.
The second part of the STSM was devoted to the
development of further MATLAB procedures. These procedures are
very simple, however it is believed that scientists willing to use
GprMax will find them useful (especially those who aren’t expert
users of MATLAB). They are available for free public download on
the COST Action TU1208 website www.GPRadar.eu. They are
reported and shortly described in the following.
2.2.1: ascan2D.m
This procedure can be used to plot an A-scan, generated by
GprMax2D. Here and in the following, according to a
nomenclature widely accepted by the GPR community, the term ‘Ascan’ refers to an array of electric-field values calculated in a fixed
spatial point and in T consecutive instants (a GPR trace).

------ascan2D-----This Matlab procedure uses data generated by 'GprMax2D',
electromagnetic wave simulator for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) modelling,
in order to display an A-scan at a given trace-number.
An A-scan is a single waveform recorded by the GPR, where the receiver is in a fixed
position and, therefore, the only variable is the time, which is related to the
survey's depth by the propagation velocity.

2.2.3: ascan2Dback.m
This procedure can be used to plot an A-scan of the backscattered field, generated by GprMax2D. In order to obtain the
field back-scattered by an object (or by a set of objects), according
to the electromagnetic-field superposition principle valid for all
linear systems, GprMax2D has to be run twice: a first time, it has
to be run in the presence of the complete scenario; a second time,
it has to be run in the presence of the same scenario without the
scattering object (or set of objects). The difference between the
obtained results will give the back-scattered field.

An A-scan of the Back-Scattered Field is obtained by subtracting
the undisturbed A-scan (i.e. without scatterers) from the one with scatterers.

2.2.4: bscan2D.m
This procedure can be used to plot a B-scan, generated by
GprMax2D. Here and in the following, the term ‘B-scan’
corresponds to a matrix of electric-field values, calculated in T
time instants and M different spatial points, meaning M A-scans
(this is equivalent to assuming that a GPR ‘stops’ in M positions,
for example along a line parallel to the air-soil interface, gathering
data in each of them; the B-scan is the comprehensive set of GPR
traces).

------bscan2D-----This Matlab procedure uses data generated by 'GprMax2D',

A B-scan is a set of A-scans, obtained by moving the transmitter and receiver
of the GPR on a line (e.g. x-axis), thus creating a 2D dataset,
the amplitude of the received signal is usually plotted in a grey-scale map
or in contour plots. The output of this procedure is a grey-scale map.

This procedure can be used to display the geometry of the model,
generated by GprMax3D. In particular, isosurfaces can be plotted,
representing the various parts/objects of the model’s geometry.
For large models with several details, this procedure doesn’t

2.3: DEFINITION OF TEST SCENARIOS FOR THE COMPARISON OF
DIFFERENT ELECTROMAGNETIC FORWARD- AND
INVERSE-SCATTERING METHODS
The third part of the STSM was devoted to the definition of a set of
test scenarios. Working Group Members who are developing
electromagnetic forward/inverse scattering techniques and
imaging methods will be provided with the geometrical and
physical characteristics defining these scenarios, as well as with
results calculated by using the GprMax software; the accuracy and
applicability of different techniques will be tested and compared on
the proposed scenarios. The aim of this initiative is not that of
identifying the best methods, but more properly to indicate the
range of reliability of each approach, highlighting its advantages
and drawbacks. The realisation of the proposed structures and the
acquisition of GPR experimental data will allow a further effective
benchmark for forward/inverse scattering methods and imaging
techniques.
The set of test scenarios is constituted by a number of
concrete
structures,
hereinafter
called
cells.
Structural
investigation of reinforced concrete through GPR is wellestablished and increasingly used [6], the principal current
applications are summarized in Table I.

The size of each cell is 60 x 100 x 18 cm and the content
varies with growing complexity, from a simple cell with few rebars
of different diameters embedded in concrete at increasing depths,
to a final cell with a quite complicated pattern, including a layer of
tendons between two overlying meshes of rebars. Other cells, of
intermediate complexity, contain pvc ducts (air filled or hosting
rebars), steel objects commonly used in civil engineering (as a
pipe, an angle bar, a box section and an u-channel), as well as
void and honeycombing defects. One of the cells has a steel mesh
embedded in it, overlying two rebars placed diagonally across the
comers of the structure. Two cells include a couple of rebars bent
into a right angle and placed on top of each other, with a
square/round circle lying at the base of the concrete slab.
Inspiration for some of these cells is taken from the very
interesting experimental work presented in [7].
For each cell, a subset of models is defined, starting from a
simple representation of the cell and ending with a more realistic
one. In particular, the model’s complexity increases from the
geometrical point of view, as well as in terms of how the
constitutive parameters of the involved media and the GPR
antennas are described.

Some cells can be simulated in both two and three
dimensions. The concrete slab can be approximated as a finitethickness layer having infinite extension on the transverse plane,
thus neglecting how edges affect radargrams, or else its finite size
can be fully taken into account.
The permittivity of concrete can be defined through a
constant real value, or else its frequency-dispersion properties can
be taken into account by incorporating into the model Debye
approximations [8] or by adopting the Joenscher model [9, 10].
The electromagnetic source can be represented as a simple
line of current (in the case of two-dimensional models), a Hertzian
dipole, a bow tie antenna, or else, the realistic description of a
commercial antenna can be included in the model [11].
The simplest three cells are sketched in Figure 1. They can
be simulated both in two and three dimensions. Cell 1.1 includes
three identical pipes buried at increasing depths, as well as
smaller and larger bars. Cell 1.2 consists of four linear targets as
follows: a rebar, two PVC ducts (one air filled and the other with a
steel rod inserted), a steel water pipe. Cell 1.3 hosts typical
reinforced concrete elements as an angle bar, a box section and a
u-channel. For these cells, input GprMax2D and GprMax3D files
are reported in Section 2.4 of this document, along with some
numerical results obtained with GprMax2D, for the simplest case
of concrete permittivity defined through a constant real value.
Further results obtained by adopting a Debye model for the
permittivity of concrete are also available but they are not included
here, for brevity reasons. Results obtained by executing the 3D
models are available, too.
2.4: MODELLING THE DEFINED TEST SCENARIOS WITH GPRMAX
2.4.1: Cell 1.1
For Cell 1.1, both 2D and a 3D models have been created.
The concrete slab has been approximated as a finite-thickness
layer having infinite extension on the transverse plane, thus
neglecting how edges affect radargrams, or else its finite size has

been fully taken into account. The compacted fill has always been
modelled as having infinite extension.

Figure 1 – Sketch of Cells 1.1 – 1.3.
All the numerical results have been obtained for a frequency
f = 1.5 GHz and a Ricker shape of the time pulse emitted by the
transmitter.
The transmitting and receiving antennas are at 2 cm from
concrete-air interface, the distance between them is 10 cm.
B-scans with 5 cm step have been calculated, in the
transverse plane, as well as A-scans above the center of each
scatterer, for both the total and the back-scattered electric field,
on a 5 ns time window.

The relative permittivity of concrete is assumed to be εr=6
and its conductivity is σ=0.01 S/m; the relative permittivity of the
compacted fill is εr=16 and its conductivity is σ=0.005 S/m.
Metallic objects are assumed to be perfectly conducting.
For the finite-size model, GprMax2D and GprMax3D input
files are reported in Table II. The spatial discretisation (size of Yee
cells) is 0.0005 m along x, y and z, representing a good
compromise between accuracy and execution time. The time
discretisation is fixed by applying the stability CFL (Courant,
Freidrichs and Lewy) condition. The simulation space is
surrounded with a layer of non physical absorbing material
occupying 10 Yee cells (i.e., Perfectly Matched Layer, PML,
Absorbing Boundary Conditions, ABCs, are employed).
For this model, Figure 2 shows the B-scan of the total
electric field and Figure 3 shows the B-scan of the electric field
back-scattered by the embedded bars, obtained with GprMax2D.
Figure 4 shows the 2D output geometry.
For the infinite model of Cell 1.1, GprMax2D and GprMax3D
input files are reported in Table III. The spatial and time
discretisation are the same and a PML occupying 10 Yee cells is
again used.
For this model, Figure 5 shows the B-scan of the total
electric field and Figure 6 shows the B-scan of the electric field
back-scattered by the embedded bars, obtained with GprMax2D,
to be compared with those shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
Figure 7 shows the 2D output geometry.
The A-scans calculated above the axes of all the rods embedded in
the concrete slab, are reported in Figures 8-15. In particular,
Figure 8 compares A-scans of the total electric field above rebars
having the same diameter (Ø 2 cm) and buried at different depths
(calculated by taking into account the finite size of concrete slab).
Figure 9 shows the same as in Figure 8, for the back-scattered
electric field. In Figure 10, results obtained for the finite-size
concrete slab are compared with those obtained for the infinite
slab. Figures 12-15 present A-scans over the three rebars having
different size (Ø 1, 2 and 3 cm) and buried at the same depth (d=9
cm).

2.4.2: Cell 1.2
For Cell 1.2, an analogous analysis has been carried out. Both 2D
and 3D models have been created. The concrete slab has been
approximated as a finite-thickness layer having infinite extension
on the transverse plane, or else its finite size has been taken into
account. The relative permittivity of PVC was assumed to be εr=3.
For the finite-size model, GprMax input files are reported In Table
IV. Results are shown in Figure 16, where the B-scan of the total
electric field is reported, and in Figure 17, where the B-scan of the
electric field back-scattered by the embedded targets is shown,
obtained with GprMax2D. Figure 18 is the 2D output geometry.
For the model with infinite concrete slab, GprMax input files are
reported In Table V. Results are shown in Figure 19, where the Bscan of the total electric field is reported, and in Figure 20, where
the B-scan of the electric field back-scattered by the embedded
targets is shown, obtained with GprMax2D.

2.5: Interaction with COST Action TU1206
COST Action TU1206 “SUB-URBAN - A European network to
improve understanding and use of the ground beneath our cities”
focuses on the development of urban subsurface knowledge, its
modeling, as well as the maximization of economic, social and
environmental benefits of subsurface resources and ecosystem
services. The possibility of organising a common workshop during
Year 2 of the Actions’ lifetime was discussed. Electromagnetic
modelling of subsurface could be a topic of common interest.
Further topics of common interest can be the application of GPR to
locate artificial (man-made) and natural sub-superficial deposits,
and the use of GPR in water management and protection.

3. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION

Thanks to this STSM, a fruitful collaboration with the host
institution has been established and will hopefully continue and
grow.
! The simulation of concrete cells will be completed.
! Iraklis Giannakis (The University of Edinburgh, UK) is
carrying out a STSM in “Roma Tre” University, on the
numerical modelling of GPR antennas with the FDTD
technique. Horn antennas as well as ridged horn antennas
are being implemented to FDTD and their effectiveness is
being tested in realistic modelled situations.
! Accurate models of the commercial antennas GSSI 1.5 GHz
and MALA 1.2 GHz have been recently incorporated in
GprMax: a comparison will be carried out, between GprMax
results obtained for these antennas and results of
commercial electromagnetic simulators as CST and HFSS,
available in “Roma Tre” University.
! A further topic of future collaboration will be implementing
in GprMax accurate models of soils as well as studying the
effects of aggregates in the electromagnetic response of
concrete. Stochastic methods can be used in order to
realistically simulate the geometrical characteristics of both
soils and concrete, advanced Debye approximations can be
incorporated in order to simulate the real dielectric
properties of the involved media in the frequency range of
interest. Thanks to the possibility of accessing the cluster
computer of The University of Edinburgh, it will be possible
to execute large problems with high resolution (1 mm).
! Innovative ideas concerning the use of metamaterials in the
design of GPR antennas and the miniaturisation of GPR
antennas were discussed during the STSM carried out in

Edinburgh. In order to develop these ideas, a new project is
starting in Working Group 1, focusing on the design,
optimisation and modelling of GPR antennas and lead by Dr.
Craig Warren (The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK).

STSM 2
THE PRESERVATION OF THE THOLOS TOMB OF ACHARNON
Visiting ESR: Dr. Sonia Santos Assuncao,
Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain
Host: Mr. Klisthenis Dimitriadis, Geoservice, Athens, Greece
STSM Dates: 15 January 2014 – 15 February 2014
1. PURPOSE OF THE STSM
During 2013 and at the beginning of 2014, an extensive
geophysical survey was carried out and it is still ongoing in a
very important Monument of the Hellenic Cultural Heritage, the
Tholos Tomb of Acharnon. The geophysical survey was carried out
from Geoservice under the supervision of Klisthenis Dimitriadis
(geophysicist).
The geophysical data acquisition has been
assisted by Yannis Konstantakis (electronic engineer). Fotini
Karassava (Architect) worked in close cooperation with
Geoservice, from the beginning of this project. Two further
organizations participate to this work in a form of partnership,
and provide assistance. These are: the 2nd Ephorate of Prehistoric
and Classical Antiquities of Greece, and the Municipality of
Acharnon. The Ephorate is the responsible authority for the
archaeological site as well as for all the ancient antiquities of
Athens area and surroundings (except the Parthenon); its task is
to protect and conserve the Antiquities in a sustainable way.
The Municipality of Acharnon is the second in size municipality
of the Attiki region, after the Municipality of Athens; its own
interests are the preservation of the Acharnon Tomb and the
touristic promotion of this monument to the maximum possible
extent.
The STSM was carried out in Geoservice and had the main
objective to study with Ground Penetrating Radar the Tomb of
Acharnon. This monument has been built in the Mycenaean

"

period (1600 BC) and is characterised by a beehive shape with a
circular base. Due to temperature and umidity variations, to
vibrations produced both by the local traffic and the earthquakes,
as well as to the high salt content of the unsaturated zone, there
are several problems inherent to the preservation of the Tomb of
Acharnon. In this STSM, the unknown thickness of the walls had
to be determined; results were plotted using circular radargrams.
Discontinuities in the radargrams may be associated to fissures
or voids, indicating internal and external (superficial) damages of
the Tomb, which are very important to be located and
characterised. A combination of GPR with electrical resistivity
tomography could allow us to perform a more accurate data
interpretation. The vibrations in the Tomb could be quantified by
using seismic measurements and the endoscopy was used to
confirm the thickness of the building walls estimated by GPR. The
host institution works with professionals from different scientific
areas such as: geophysics, geochemistry, civil engineering,
conservation and archaeology. A multidisciplinary team is
essential to correctly interpret GPR radargrams.
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM
Data acquisition was carried out in two areas of the Tomb:
internal and external (i.e., the surface of the structure covering
the Tomb). The internal part has been subdivided into three
parts: i) the dromos, constituting the path to the Tomb, ii) the
entrance, representing the connection between the dromos and
the external part of the Tomb, and iii) the Tomb walls.
The STSM was principally focused to the study of the Tomb
walls (iii), a structure characterised by 8.4 m diameter and 9 m
height. Radar data were acquired and plotted in circular profiles.
The surfaces of the walls were extremely irregular. Hence, a
thin polyurethane foam sheet was used to obtain a more regular
surface in order to avoid noise as a consequence of the rough
stone walls, see Figure 1, left part. This sheet also allows
protecting the antenna from mechanical erosion. The effect of this
thin extra-layer is not perceptible in radar images.

Profiles were marked on the walls with a laser. The antenna
was moved along the line described by the laser, figure 1, right.
The complex structure required high coordination in the
radar acquisition tasks, and a minimum of four persons were
needed to execute properly all the process, adapting accurately
the polyurethane sheet and assuring uniform motion of the radar
antenna. A survey wheel provided the determination of the
antenna position.
The height of the Tomb was 9 m. Therefore, the first 2 m
could be studied without problems; the evaluation of the upper
levels required the installation of scaffoldings. Three platforms
divided the total volume in four parts (level 0, 1, 2 and 3),
allowing the access to entire wall.
Three different center frequency antennas were used in the
study. The inner part of the Tomb was evaluated by means of a 1
GHz center frequency antenna, obtaining enough resolution to
image the walls until 1 m of thickness.

Figure 1 – Data acquisition. Left: Sample of the anomalous surface
with a fissure. Right: Laser to produce the circular profiles.

In the exterior of the Tomb, a 500 MHz center frequency
antenna was used, to study the material covering the Tomb.
Finally, a 2.3 GHz center frequency antenna was employed to

analyze the radar wave velocity that was used to convert two-way
travel times into depths.
3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM
An accurate analysis of the radar data allowed us to define the
existence of two irregular layers of stones that constitute the walls
of the Tomb. The main anomalies are caused by discontinuities in
the materials. An average thickness could be determined, although
it was highly variable. Figure 2 shows the radar image over one
meter; this data are extracted from a circular profile. Figure 3
shows the whole circular radargram, taking into account and
representing the geometry of the Tomb. Both figures illustrate the
existence of layers, irregular targets and discontinuities associated
to cracks, fissures and voids. High attenuation was present in
several areas. This effect was caused by the presence of salt.
In the circular radargrams, reported in Figure 3, it is
possible to appreciate the thickness of the wall and the
discontinuities of internal layers to be associated with fissures and
voids. Due to localized signal attenuation and presence of salts
detected by visual inspection, it is also possible to map zones with
higher salt content. The three dimensional model, resulting from
the interpolation of GPR profiles collected at different heights,
provides an estimation of the real shape of the anomalies as well
as the possibility to analyze their vertical continuity.
The GPR data are in accordance with the results of the
micro-resistivity surveys carried out in a second phase of the
study. This additional geophysical method used ERT (Electrical
Resistivity Tomography) to map the walls in profiles of 3.1 m. This
allowed us to verify the interface between the wall of the grave
(schist stones) and his geological environment (very fine sand). In
Figure 4, a characteristic profile is presented. Low resistivity
correspond to sand and high resistivity (red areas) to the wall of
the grave.

4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION
Given the results obtained in Tomb of Acharnon, the methodology
used to analyze the Tomb of Acharnon could be standardized. In
this way, this procedure cOULD be applied to other archaeological
monuments.
The circular GPR technology is of great interest for the host
institution, especially to carry out investigations of Ancient
columns, mostly made of marble or sandstone, in order to map
stone imperfections or internal cracks and deterioration.

STSM 3
NUMERICAL MODELLING OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR ANTENNAS
Visiting Researcher: Mr. Iraklis Giannakis
The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom
Host: Dr. Lara Pajewski, Roma Tre University, Rome, Italy
STSM Dates: 22 January 2014 – 22 March 2014

1. PURPOSE OF THE STSM
Realistic and effective ground penetrating radar (GPR) modelling is
based on efficient and accurate solutions of Maxwell’s equations.
Numerical methods for solving Maxwell’s equations range from
finite element methods, the method of moments, finite difference
implicit techniques, transmission-line matrix (TLM) methods and
others (Sadiku, 2000). One of the most highly used methods
however is the finite difference time domain (FDTD). The reasons
for its popularity are its simplicity and computational efficiency
(Taflove, 2000).
GprMax (Giannopoulos, 2005) is a freely available GPR
modelling software package, which solves Maxwell’s equations and
is used throughout this paper. GprMax employs a second order in
both space and time FDTD algorithm first described by Yee (1966).
GPR numerical modelling has been widely used to study and
enhance data understanding and interpretation in a variety of
GPR applications. Amongst them, dense non-aqueous phase
liquids (DNAPL) detection (Wilson et. al. 2007), tunnel inspections
(Xianqi et. al. 2009), bridges evaluation (Diamanti et. al. 2011),
forensic applications (Hannon et. al. 2000), landmine detection
(Oguz and Gurel 2000). For near surface applications however,
like forensic, engineering and landmine detection, the scale of the
problem and the proximity of targets to GPR sensors gives rise to
some unique characteristics which must be taken into account for

"

realistic and effective GPR modelling. Two of the most important of
these characteristics are:
•

•

The antenna occupies a relative large volume in the modelled
domain, this means that the antenna is not only related to the
characteristics of the transmitted pulse (directivity, central
frequency etc.) but also is part of the model, which contributes
to the measured scattered field.
Increased sensitivity to background characteristics due to the
high frequency content of the pulse, this means that media
inhomogeneity and rough surfaces must be included into the
model.

A numerical pavement-evaluation case study is presented in
this report, to illustrate the developed modelling framework.
Pavement evaluation traditionally requires the retrieval of
information about the layer thickness within the pavement as well
as the dielectric properties of the latter. Air-coupled horn antennas
are often used for this purpose. The main drawbacks of horn
antennas are their low spatial resolution and their inability to
often illustrate clear hyperbolic scattering phenomena (Diamanti,
2012). The mentioned drawbacks create doubts about the
effectiveness of air-coupled antennas in detecting lateral cracks
within the pavement.
In our simulations, pavement is realistically modeled.
Fractals are used to mathematically define the stochastic variation
of the dielectric properties within the pavement as well as its
rough surface. Two different antennas, one air-coupled horn
antenna and one ground-coupled bowtie, are implemented into the
model and their effectiveness in pavement evaluation and crack
detection is compared.
The main aim is to present and establish a realistic
modeling framework that can be used in evaluating antenna
designs and their performance in complex near surface GPR
investigations.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM

Air coupled antennas like horn antennas have been extensively
used for pavement evaluation using Ground Penetrating Radar
(GPR). The main reasons for that are:
•
•
•

They are capable to detect thin layers.
They operate safely in highway speeds because they don’t need
to be close to the ground.
They are relative easy to manufacture.

We examine an E-plane monostatic horn antenna with
central frequency of 2.6 GHz.
Regarding the feeding of the antenna, a TE10 mode is used
which is excited inside a rectangular waveguide with dimensions
0.25 x 0.022 m. With the previously mentioned dimensions, a
single mode of propagation in the frequency range 0.6 – 6.8 GHz is
achieved. The receiver is modeled by a coaxial cable. The inner
and outer conductor of the coaxial cable have radii of 0.5 mm and
4 mm respectively and it is filled with plastic with relative
electrical permittivity equal to 2.5. The spatial discretization step
of the model is Δl =1 mm and the time step is equal with Δt =1.925
ps (Courant limit). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the geometry of the
antenna and the propagation of the TE10 mode inside it.
Apart from the horn antenna described above, a ground
coupled bowtie antenna is also implemented into the models
(Figure 3). The model of this antenna is based on a commercial
available antenna, which is designed for near surface applications
as introduced by Warren and Giannopoulos 2011.
The previously described antennas are tested in a realistic
pavement evaluation scenario. The pavement consists of two
layers, the asphalt layer and the base as depicted in Figure 4.

Figure 3 - Ground coupled bowtie antenna
with central frequency of 1.6 GHz.
The asphalt layer has a relative electric permittivity, which
varies stochastically from 6 to 8 and the base from 10 to 12. The
conductivity of both layers is equal to σ =0.01 S/m. Fractals were
used in order to create realistic variations of the dielectric
properties within each layer. The pavement’s surface is relatively
smooth with small variations as it is expected in old or highly used
roads. Again fractals were used to incorporate the rough surface.
Three cracks created using random walks are implemented into
the model. The cracks are filled with air and they have a 3 mm
width. One of them occurs in the first layer but does not reach the
surface, another one occurs in the second layer and the third one
cuts through both layers. The dimensions of the model (x, y, z) are
1300 x 300 x 600 mm. The simulations were executed in a parallel
computing environment using the cluster computer provided by
The University of Edinburgh. In order to reduce the computational
cost, we divide the domain in subdomains according to the
position of the antenna unit. Every trace of the resulting B-scan is
as a result calculated in a different subdomain. Using this scheme
we have assumed that the scattering field that might exist outside
of the subdomains is negligible compared with the scattering field
inside the subdomain.

The horn antenna is placed at 20 cm above the ground while
the bowtie antenna is placed 2 cm above the ground. Figure 5
illustrates the resulting B-scans from both antennas. A linear gain
is applied to the resulting B-scan using the horn antenna. From
Figure 5 (left side) is evident that clear reflections from the base
are obtained and the cracks practically do not contribute to the
received scattering field.Using the bowtie antenna and a singular
value decomposition (Kim et. al. 2000) results to the B-scans
shown in Figure 5 (right side). From the B-scans it is evident that
all the cracks give clearer and more prominent interpretable
hyperbolic responses.

medium is consisted with two non-homogenous layers and three
air-filled cracks are also included into the model.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM

An air-coupled horn antenna and a ground-coupled bowtie
antenna are tested in a realistically modeled pavement evaluation
scenario. The numerical results indicate that air-coupled antennas
receive clear reflections from distinct layers within the pavement
but they are incapable in this setting to detect cracks filled with
air. On the other hand, using ground-coupled antennas results to
clear and easy to interpret hyperbolic responses from the buried
cracks. The developed modeling framework is a powerful tool in
evaluating the performance of high frequency GPR transducers in
realistic situations and this approach can lead to better design of
GPR antennas.
4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION
Air coupled antennas are a very practical choice for pavement
evaluation due to their ability to operate on highway speeds. The
research done so far suggest that air coupled antennas like horn
antennas are not effective when it comes to air filled crack
detection. Future work will include the design of a novel air
couples antenna which will be able to reliable detect air filled
cracks.
Future work also includes modeling of generic type of GPR
antennas and assessing their performance in more case civil
engineering applications.

STSM 4
RECONSTRUCTING PREHISTORIC ENVIRONMENTS AT STONEHENGE
WITH MULTIPLE ELECTROMAGNETIC SURVEY METHODS

Visiting ESR: Mr Philippe De Smedt,
Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium
Host: Dr Immo Trinks, Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for
Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology,
Vienna, Austria
STSM Dates: 1 February 2014 – 31 March 2014
1. PURPOSE OF THE STSM
The rationale of this project is that by mapping electromagnetic
soil properties using different near surface geophysical survey
methods an integral reconstruction can be attempted of the
variations
caused
by
anthropological,
pedological
and
geomorphological structures in the subsurface. In order to achieve
this,
datasets
from
different
multichannel
GPR
and
electromagnetic survey systems will be compared and jointly
interpreted. The different datasets that were processed, analysed
and compared were data from 1) a multi-receiver electromagnetic
induction (EMI) survey, and 2) a 3D ground-penetrating (GPR)
survey collected. The EMI data were collected in 2012 by the
Research Group Soil Spatial Inventory Techniques (ORBit) from
Ghent University (Belgium), while the GPR data were gathered by
the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Virtual Archaeology and
Archaeological Prospection (LBI ArchPro) from Vienna (Austria).
The multi-receiver EMI data were collected with a Dualem21s sensor that records the soil apparent electrical conductivity
(ECa) and the apparent magnetic susceptibility (MSa) data of four
different soil volumes simultaneously. The sensor consists of 1
transmitter and four receiver coils spaced 1 m, 1.1 m, 2 m and 2.1
m apart. The receiver coils at 1 m and 2 m from the transmitter
are placed in horizontal coplanar mode (1 m and 2 m HCP

"

respectively), while those at 1.1 m and 2.1 m are placed in
perpendicular mode (1.1 m PRP and 2.2 m PRP respectively). This
results in penetration depths down to 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m and 3.2
m below the surface for the ECa data. Further information on the
Dualem-21s sensor can be found in (Saey et al., 2009). The multilayered dataset offers insight into the vertical and lateral
variations in ECa and MSa and can serve as a basis for the 3D
reconstruction of subsurface variations (e.g. Saey et al 2008, De
Smedt et al. 2013).
The 3D GPR data, gathered with a MALÅ Imaging Radar
Array (MIRA) system in motorized configuration, provides
information on the soil dielectric permittivity and on soil
discontinuities in 3D. This MIRA system consists of 16×400 MHz
channels with 0.08 m cross-line channel spacing and possibilities
for 0.04 m or 0.08 m in-line GPR trace spacing.
During the research stay we aimed at creating a robust
methodological foundation for the combined analysis of the EMI
and GPR data on which we can build future work and research
combining these two methods.
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM
During the research stay at the LBI ArchPro, EMI data gathered at
Stonehenge were processed to allow combination with the GPR
data. The different available GPR datasets of the study area were
simultaneously analyzed, and an area was selected where the EMI
and GPR datasets would be jointly analysed and combined (Fig. 1).
This specific area was selected as 1) it holds clearly defined
remains of a prehistoric monument (Fig. 2a), which was
interpreted as a segmented ditch, 2) a number of geomorphological
variations were observed in the EMI data (a palaeoriver (Fig. 2b)
and variations in the chalk bedrock morphology (Fig. 2c). A
comparison between the different geophysical datasets in this area
would allow addressing the main research questions; i.e. a better
understanding
of
the
anthropological,
pedological
and
geomorphological variations within the Stonehenge World Heritage
Site.

The main research effort during the STSM was directed
towards a better understanding of the pedology and
geomorphology of the study area through the combined analysis of
GPR and EMI data.
As a starting point, geostatistical analyses were performed
on the EMI data to extract only variations that could be attributed
to the morphology of the chalk bedrock. For this, ECa data from
the 2.1 m PRP coil configuration (Fig. 2, left) were deemed the
most suited as the depth sensitivity of these measurements
accords with the depth range of the targeted soil variation (i.e.
between 0-1 m below surface (Fig. 4). These slices were produced
through in-house developed software from the LBI ArchPro
institute.

MSa data (right) from the 2012 EMI survey area. The subzone that
was selected for detailed analysis during the STSM is highlighted

more conductive soil. Right: 2 m HCP MSa data with indication of
the prehistoric monument (a) that is visible as a segmented ditch,
and indication of the increased magnetic susceptibility that is
attributed to palaeochannel sediments.
After these datasets were produced, areas were selected
where a significant overlap could be found between strong
reflections in the GPR data on the one hand, and shallow bedrock
as located through the classified ECa data. At these locations the
preliminary depths, as extracted from the GPR profiles and depth
slices where compared to the ECa data values from all coil pairs
from the Dualem-21s sensor. Following the procedure of Saey et
al. 2008 and De Smedt et al. 2011, these depths were then used
as calibration values to model the depth of the chalk bedrock
based on the ECa data.

Figure 3 - GPR depth slices representative for a depth range of 00.5 m below the surface (left) and for a range of 0-1 m below the
surface (right).
The second research topic that was addressed, focused on
the archaeological variations within the study area. Again
geostatistical data analyses were used as a starting point. The
main datasets that were used were the MSa data from the 1 m and
2 m HCP coil configurations (Fig. 1 and 2, right), and the 0-0.5 m
GPR depth slice (Fig. 3, left). Principal component analysis was
conducted in Isatis to visualize the small scale variation present
within these datasets within the study area. In a final step, the
results of the first and second research topics were combined to
allow a fuller interpretation of the subsurface variation within the
study area.
3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM
Analysis of the 2.1 m PRP data showed a distinct large scale
spatial variation that could be clearly visualized through isolating

the relevant spatial structural component with factorial kriging
(Fig. 4, left). The resulting data were then successfully classified
through fuzzy k means classification, offering a detailed map of the
geomorphological variation that was detected through the EMI
survey (Fig. 4, right).

Fig. 4: Left: Residual 2.1 m PRP ECa data produced through
factorial kriging analysis, representing the large scale spatial
variation within the study area. Right: Classified residual 2.1 m
PRP ECa data. The low ECa data (red) class can be interpreted as
shallow chalk bedrock, while the high ECa data class (blue)
represents deeper bedrock (i.e. thicker overlaying soil layer). The
areas indicated with 1 and 2 are those were the best visual
correlation was found with high reflections in the GPR depth slice.
Visual comparison between the high reflections in the 0-0.5
m GPR depth slice (Fig. 3) and the areas with shallow chalk as
present in the classified EMI ECa data, allowed identifying two
zones where a direct correlation could be witnessed between these
datasets (1 and 2 on Fig. 4).

We attempted to correlate these structures to specific
reflections in the separate GPR profiles, but were unable to do so
in a robust manner during the STSM. The correlation was only
possible based on the visual analysis of the 0.5 m thick GPR slice
and of 0.05 m thick slices within the 0 – 0.5 m depth range. We
found that only at specific locations the GPR reflections could be
correlated to the depth of the interface between the soil and the
underlying chalk bedrock. It was therefore proposed that the
boundary between soil and bedrock was often characterized by a
gradual transition between the weathered soil material and the
underlying chalk. While the difference in electrical conductivity
allows discerning between these two layers (i.e. soil and chalk),
these do not represent discontinuities that are easily identified in
the non-migrated GPR data. The largest reflections in the GPR
data are produced by discontinuities present within the chalk
bedrock (e.g. fractures and intercalated flint patches) (Fig. 5).
To model morphology of the chalk bedrock, we therefore
introduced preliminary depths into the modeling procedure based
on the correspondence between the 0.05 m thick GPR slices and
the EMI classification. This way, we were able to generate a
preliminary model of the bedrock morphology (Fig. 6). The
resulting model shows a different morphology than the smooth
current topography.
In a following step the comparison of the MSa data and the
GPR data was taken on. After resampling the data to the same
grid, PCA of the different datasets were conducted. It was found
that the correlations between them were not significant (i.e. r <
0.1) to provide a basis for detailed interpretation of the detected
variations (a problem which was equally observed by Kvamme
(2006) when combining multiple geophysical datasets for
archaeological interpretation). However, visualizing the first
component loadings of the PCA of the full 2 m HCP MSa dataset
and the 0.5 m thick GPR slice, did offer a straightforward insight
into the features that contribute the most to the combined
variance within the study area. While the resulting data offer no
basis for quantitative analysis or characterization of the detected

"

features, these do facilitate the visual evaluation of the small scale
variation present within both datasets.
The features indicated on Fig. 7 represent the clearest and
most characteristic anomalies that were found through the
evaluation of the combined data plot. In the center of the area, a
prehistoric monument is present that was most visible in the MSa
data. Southwest of the segmented ditch, a strong reflection can be
seen leading up to this monument. Adjacent this reflection, the
bedrock model reveals small depressions that are possibly manmade.

suggested by the EMI data analysis (see Fig. 4). The location where
shallow bedrock was assumed is indicated (left arrow) along with a
characteristic deeper GPR reflection as present throughout the
entire dataset (right arrow).

Farther to the edge of the area we find another, larger
depression in the bedrock that leads from the palaeochannel
deposits in the far south(west) of the area and directs towards the
monument. This depression is flanked by two linear expressions of
shallow bedrock, present in both the GPR and ECa data.
The presented results show the potential of combining EMI
and GPR for detecting and characterizing different types of
subsurface variations at Stonehenge. While during the research
stay the results have been mainly descriptive, we did however lay
out a methodological work flow for a quantitative combination of
the different datasets.
4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION

We are currently already advancing the work that was started
during the STSM. To further the modelling of the calcareous
bedrock, we are reprocessing the GPR data. This work is being
done in close collaboration with the LBI ArchPro (more specifically
with Eng. Alois Hinterleitner and Dr. Immo Trinks), dr. Lieven
Verdonck (Dept. of archaeology, Ghent University) and the ORBit
research group from Ghent University. To date we have
successfully migrated the GPR data, offering a more accurate
insight into the true depth of the detected features. This is also
allowing to better discern the interface between the soil and the
underlying bedrock (Fig. 7).
In a following step we will conduct a correlation analysis
between the migrated GPR data and the ECa data (see above) to
establish a calibration dataset and build a bedrock model with
increased accuracy.
Based on the further processing and analysis of the GPR
data, we plan to investigate the relationship between the MSa data
and the small scale anomalies present in the GPR data. Here as
well, the migration of the GPR data should provide a rigorous basis
for a more robust comparison of these two data types.
While this was not elaborated on during the STSM, we have
started comparing the MSa data to the magnetometry data from
the LBI ArchPro. These data were exchanged during the research

stay and we are pursuing a combination of these two datasets to
better characterize the nature of magnetic variations within the
study area (e.g. discerning between recent metal debris and
relevant archaeological variations within the study area).

data, in the bottom illustration a minute reflection is traced that

5. FORESEEN PUBLICATIONS/ARTICLES RESULTING FROM THE STSM

We aim at a publication on the joint use of 3D GPR data and
multi-receiver EMI (ECa) data to model the depth to a pre-defined
soil layer at Stonehenge. The model results presented in this
report are a prelude to this work, and the reprocessing of the GPR
data discussed above are providing the basis for a more
quantitative data integration needed for such a publication.
The combined analysis of the MSa and magnetometry data is
also aimed towards at least one publication. This work mainly
focusses on differentiating between recent and archaeological soil
intrusions.

Ground Penetrating Radar” and TD1301 “Development of a
European-based
Collaborative
Network
to
Accelerate
Technological, Clinical and Commercialisation Progress in the Area
of Medical Microwave Imaging,” in cooperation with the European
School of Antennas (ESoA), successfully organised a Training
School (TS) on “Microwave Imaging and Diagnostics: Theory,
Techniques, and Applications.”
The school was held in Madonna di Campiglio, a charming
and elegant Italian village nestling at an altitude of 1550 metres in
the stupendous valley between the Brenta Dolomites and the
glaciers of Adamello and Presanella.
Electromagnetic waves can be exploited as sensing tools in a
number of interesting engineering applications including Ground
Penetrating Radar (GPR) prospection, antenna characterisation,
biomedical diagnostics, through-the-wall imaging, and many
others. The TS, after reviewing fundamental equations and main
difficulties of inverse problems in high-frequency electromagnetics,
focused on classical and innovative imaging techniques.

TRAINING SCHOOL 2
FUTURE RADAR SYSTEMS: RADAR 2020
Organised by:
COST Action TU1208, European School of Antennas (ESoA),
European Microwave Association
Venue: Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany
Dates: 24-28 March, 2014
Report by the MC Chair, Lara Pajewski

The COST Action TU1208 “Civil Engineering Applications of
Ground Penetrating Radar,” the European School of Antennas
(ESoA) and the European Microwave Association (EuMA),
organised a Training School on "Future Radar Systems:
Radar2020."
The School was held in the Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 5-9, 2014, and it
covered the state of the art and new trends on radar technologies.
After an introduction to the radar basics, including
propagation of electromagnetic waves, radar equation, polarimetry,
analysis of Radar Cross Section (RCS) of targets and RCS
measurement, the current radar types were presented, as the CW-,
FMCW-, pulse-, MTI-, mono-pulse-, and UWB-radar. These lessons
were complemented by the waveform and radar-parameter topics.
The core part of the course was the presentation of concepts
relevant to future radars, which will be significantly different from
the state of the art radars, with innovative system functions like
digital beamforming, MIMO radar, intelligent signal coding (for
example OFDM) and antenna array imaging for high resolutionsmall-size radars. Typical radar-antenna concepts for beamforming, arrays, and phased-arrays were presented, too. Another
core part of the course was represented by the introduction to
some special radar applications, like automotive radar, ultra
wideband radar, Ground Penetrating Radar, through-the-wall
radar, and Synthetic Aperture Radar for imaging.

COST - European Cooperation in Science and Technology is an intergovernmental
framework aimed at facilitating the collaboration and networking of scientists
and researchers at European level. It was established in 1971 by 19 member
countries and currently includes 35 member countries across Europe, and Israel
as a cooperating state.
COST funds pan-European, bottom-up networks of scientists and researchers
across all science and technology fields. These networks, called 'COST Actions',
promote international coordination of nationally-funded research. By fostering
the networking of researchers at an international level, COST enables breakthrough scientific developments leading to new concepts and products, thereby
contributing to strengthening Europe’s research and innovation capacities.
COST’s mission focuses in particular on: building capacity by connecting high
quality scientific communities throughout Europe and worldwide; providing
networking opportunities for early career investigators; increasing the impact of
research on policy makers, regulatory bodies and national decision makers as
well as the private sector.
Through its inclusiveness, COST supports the integration of research
communities, leverages national research investments and addresses issues of
global relevance. Every year thousands of European scientists benefit from being
involved in COST Actions, allowing the pooling of national research funding to
achieve common goals.
As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST anticipates and
complements the activities of EU Framework Programmes, constituting a “bridge”
towards the scientific communities of emerging countries. In particular, COST
Actions are also open to participation by non-European scientists coming from
neighbour countries (for example Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, the
Palestinian Authority, Russia, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine) and from a number of
international partner countries.
COST's budget for networking activities has traditionally been provided by
successive EU RTD Framework Programmes. COST is currently executed by the
European Science Foundation (ESF) through the COST Office on a mandate by
the European Commission, and the framework is governed by a Committee of
Senior Officials (CSO) representing all its 35 member countries.
More information about COST is available at www.cost.eu.
The scientific activities of the COST Action TU1208 are carried out within
four Working Groups (WGs). The effectiveness of this scheme will be checked
after the first year of activities and will eventually be modified, considering the
actual number of active participants in each WG. The structure of each WG
will always be kept as flexible as possible, in order to enable new participants
to join. All the participants, when joining the Action, are invited to provide
basic information on their experience, interests, and current research projects,
as well as WGs and Projects preferences. Each participant can belong to two
WGs and an arbitrary number of projects within the chosen WGs.
The four TU1208 WGs are: WG1 – Novel GPR instrumentation; WG2 – GPR
surveying of pavements, bridges, tunnels and buildings; underground utility
and void sensing; WG3 – EM methods for near-field scattering problems by
buried structures and data processing techniques; WG4 – Different
applications of GPR and other NDT technologies in civil engineering. The WG
meetings constitute an opportunity to present activities, results and plans for
the future. Between meetings, the WG members regularly interact.
