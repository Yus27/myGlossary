PREFACE
TO THE

PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST ACTION’S GENERAL MEETING –
COST ACTION TU1208
“CIVIL ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF
GROUND PENETRATING RADAR”

The First Action’s General Meeting of COST Action TU1208 “Civil
Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar,” is held in
Rome, Italy, from the 22nd to the 24th of July, 2013. There are about
100 scientific participants attending this international event, from 19
European Countries.
Overall, the First Action’s General Meeting includes the Action’s
Management Committee Meeting, the Steering Group Meeting, and the
Meetings of the four Working Groups, composing the general pattern of
the scientific program of the Action. Therefore, this event constitutes a
valuable opportunity to meet the participants of the COST Action
TU1208 as well as a prestigious forum for a promising discussion and a
wide exchange of knowledge and experience related to the use of GPR in
civil engineering problems.
The meeting is mainly devoted to address the state of the art,
advancements, ongoing studies and open problems, in the fields of GPR
technologies and methodologies, inspection strategies and practices,
electromagnetic methods for the modelling of GPR scenarios, and
numerical algorithms for the processing of GPR data. This event also
aims at emphasizing the importance of the relations between the
discussed scientific-technological issues and the social and economical
concerns. A further objective of the meeting is to exchange and discuss
preliminary ideas about the definition and coordination of test
scenarios, representing both typical and unusual situations that may
occur in civil engineering tasks, for an effective comparison between
different
advanced
GPR
equipment,
inspection
procedures,
electromagnetic methods and data-processing algorithms.
It is a great honour to have Prof. David J. Daniels attending the meeting
and giving a plenary talk on GPR design challenges. The purpose of this
talk is to provide an overview of GPR system design issues, for the
various modulation techniques, simultaneously suggesting what
improvements in subsystems - such as antennas, receivers and
transmitters - are needed to increase overall GPR performance.
We are honoured by the presence of Dr. Erica Utsi as well, presenting
the EuroGPR activities and being available to discuss with the Action’s
participants ideas and proposals on possible joint initiatives between
the EuroGPR Association and the COST Action TU1208.
We are also delighted to attend the plenary talk given by Prof. Antonis
Giannopoulos, Chair of the Working Group 3, about the finite-difference
time-domain method and the well-known GPR simulation tool GPRMAX,
3

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

which he has developed in his career as a researcher. This talk includes
an overview on the progress reached by the FDTD modelling over the
last twenty years and provides instructions on possible developments to
be pursued in the next future.
Furthermore, it is a great pleasure to have Dr. Immo Trinks, Chair of
the Working Group 4, giving a plenary talk about large-scale
archaeological prospection using GPR array systems, and presenting
extraordinary results collected by his research team at the Roman town
of Carnuntum, located about 30 km south-east of Vienna, in Austria.
Between 2012 and 2015, the entire Carnuntum is being mapped in
great detail using non-invasive prospection methods, as an excellent
example of how high-resolution GPR measurements are of fundamental
importance for the detection, mapping, documentation and
investigation of the buried cultural heritage in three dimensions.
The Proceedings of the event include a special paper by Prof. David J.
Daniels, resuming the plenary talk given during the meeting by the
author. The characteristics of GPR systems are reviewed, with
particular reference to the various modulation techniques. The issues
related to the design of GPR antennas are considered and possible areas
for further research and development are described. A brief discussion
of signal processing is included and some new GPR applications are
suggested.
The Proceedings of the First Action’s General Meeting also collect three
abstracts by Dr. Erica Utsi, Prof. Antonis Giannopoulos and Dr. Immo
Trinks, summarizing their plenary talks.
The Working Group 1 (WG1) of COST Action TU1208 focuses on the
design of innovative GPR equipment, on the building of prototypes, as
well as on the testing and optimization of new systems. Besides the
above-mentioned special paper by Prof. D. J. Daniels, this volume
includes three papers developed by WG1 Members. The contribution by
Dr. G. Manacorda, Chair of the WG1, Dr. A. Simi, and Dr. H. F. Scott,
regards the state of the art and open issues in the field of the design,
realization and optimization of radars devoted to the monitoring of
critical transport infrastructures, to the survey of buildings, as well as
to the sensing of underground utilities and voids. A further paper by Dr.
R. Persico, Dr. N. Masini, Dr. M. Ciminale, and Dr. L. Matera, presents
an innovative reconfigurable stepped frequency GPR and reports
preliminary results obtained by using this system. The contribution by
Dr. L. Gamma, Vice-Chair of WG1, focuses on testing, calibration and
stability procedures/protocols for GPR equipment.
The Working Group 2 (WG2) of COST Action TU1208 deals with the
GPR surveying of transport infrastructures and buildings, as well as on
the sensing of underground utilities and voids. These Proceedings
include four papers prepared by WG2 Members. A first paper, authored
by Dr. J. Stryk and Dr. R. Matula, regards the state of the art and open
issues in the field of the GPR inspection procedures for the surveying of
pavements, bridges, and tunnels. The paper by Dr. C. Plati and Dr. X.
4

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

Derobert, Chair and Vice-Chair of WG2, respectively, makes the point
on the use of GPR for the detection of underground utilities and voids.
The contribution by Dr. L. Krysiński, gives a review of the methods
related to the assessment of construction materials properties through
the use of GPR techniques, discussing the research topics to be further
developed and the main problems in this area. Finally, the manuscript
by F. Tosti deals with the estimation, through GPR techniques, of the
volumetric water content in structures, sub-structures, foundations
and soil.
The Working Group 3 (WG3) of COST Action TU1208 is developing
accurate and fast electromagnetic scattering methods for the
characterization of relevant scenarios in GPR applications, as well as
effective data-processing algorithms for the elaboration of GPR data
collected during civil engineering surveys. Besides the above-mentioned
abstract by Dr. A. Giannopoulos, this volume collects five papers
written by WG3 Members. The paper by Dr. C. Ponti focuses on the
state of the art and open issues in the development of full-wave
methods for the solution of forward electromagnetic scattering problems
by buried structures. A further paper by Prof. R. Solimene and Dr. A.
Randazzo, instead, focuses on inverse electromagnetic scattering
problems by buried structures. Next, the paper by Prof. S. Lambot
concerns the development of intrinsic models for the description of
near-field antenna effects, including antenna-medium coupling, for
improved radar data processing using full-wave inversion. The paper by
Dr. I. Catapano and Prof. E. Slob makes the point on shapereconstruction and quantitative estimation of electromagnetic and
physical properties from GPR data. Finally, the paper by Dr. N.
Economou, Prof. A. Vafidis, and Dr. F. Benedetto, provides the reader
with a deep understanding of the state of the art and open issues in the
field of GPR data processing techniques.
The Working Group 4 (WG4) of COST Action TU1208 focuses on
different applications of GPR and on other Non-Destructive Testing
(NDT) techniques for civil engineering applications. Besides the abovementioned abstract by Dr. I. Trinks, this volume includes four papers
written by WG4 Members. The paper by F. Soldovieri is concerned with
a review of the recent advances related to the use of GPR, and its
integration with other NDT techniques, in the applicative domain of the
archaeological prospecting and cultural heritage diagnostics and
monitoring; the main scientific/technological challenges are identified
and possible strategies to tackle them are devised with a particular
interest to the role that the COST Action TU1208 could play. The paper
by Dr. L. Crocco and Prof. V. Ferrara addresses a challenging and
emerging field of application of GPR, namely the localization of buried or
trapped people, possibly exploiting the detection of the Doppler
frequency changes induced by their physiological movements as heartbeat and breathing; the main motivations for which the topic is worth to
be considered in the framework of the COST Action TU1208 are
5

outlined and an overview of some relevant literature is provided. The
paper by Dr. M. Solla focuses on the use of GPR combined with other
NDT methods in the surveying of transport infrastructures: published
works in roads and pavements, concrete and masonry structures, and
tunnel testing, are resumed. In geotechnical and geological tasks, the
efficiency of GPR is strongly dependent on the site conditions, mostly
due to the limited in-depth penetration and target discrimination: the
paper by Dr. K. Dimitriadis and Dr. V. Perez-Gracia resumes the state
of the art in this field and discusses how future research has to be
oriented in order to improve the application of GPR and other NDT
techniques in geotechnical and geological applications.

Radar that still remain to be solved, as well as some of the issues that systems
designers need to consider in developing new technology and techniques. Two
applications are suggested for further development.

INTRODUCTION

In Section II this paper reviews the characteristics of Ground
Penetrating Radar with particular reference to the various modulation
techniques. In Section III some of the issues relating to the design of
antennas are considered and possible areas for further research and
development are reviewed. A brief discussion of signal processing is
included in Section IV and some suggested areas of application for
ground penetrating radar are described in Section V. One of the
common themes associated with ground penetrating radar is the
methodology of testing and verification and this is discussed in Section
VI. The paper concludes in Section VII.
II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
GPR is a technique based on the principles of RADAR (RAdio Detection
And Ranging) to measure the location and size of targets buried in
visually opaque material. The design and principles of GPR are
described by Daniels [1], [2] and in the hands of an expert provides a
safe and non-invasive method of performing speculative searches
without the need for unnecessary disruption and excavation. GPR has
significantly improved the efficiency and safety of the exploratory work
that is fundamental to the construction and civil engineering industries,
the police and forensic sectors, security/intelligence forces, geological
hazards, mineral resource, ground water, environmental and
archaeological surveys.
GPR relies for its operational effectiveness on successfully meeting
the following requirements:



efficient coupling of electromagnetic radiation into the ground;
adequate penetration of the radiation through the ground having
regard to target depth;
7

TUD COST Action TU1208






obtaining from buried objects or other dielectric, conductive or
magnetic discontinuities (contrasts) a sufficiently large scattered
signal for detection at or above the ground surface or within or
between boreholes, trenches or mine shafts;
adequate bandwidth in the detected signal having regard to the
desired resolution and noise levels;
adequate wavelength and polarization of electric field compared to
the size, shape and orientation (geometry) of the buried object for
detection.

The physics and technology of GPR and its ability to detect buried
targets are well understood and proven even though the underlying
physics and engineering are not simple.
The various factors that need to be considered in the design of GPR
systems are shown in Fig. 1.
Most GPRs for operate in a region where the wavelengths radiated
are greater than, or in the same order of magnitude as the dimensions
of the target. This is between the Rayleigh and Mie (or resonance) region
of the target dimensions and is quite unlike conventional radar systems
where the target dimensions are generally much larger than the
wavelength of the incident radiation, i.e., the optical region. Planar
interfaces may have cross track dimensions significantly greater than
the wavelengths radiated but thin layers as in road construction, may
be the same order of magnitude dimensionally as the wavelengths
radiated.

GPR performance can be predicted with some accuracy given
information on the characteristics of the soil or host material and
target. A GPR will detect, within the limits of the physics of propagation,
all changes in electromagnetic impedance in the material under
investigation. Some of these changes will be associated with wanted
targets, others may not be and the required signal from one
investigation may be clutter to another. For example, one user may
want to see rebar while another wants to see past the rebar to obtain
the thickness of concrete. The radar has, in general, no way of
discriminating specified targets unless very sophisticated recognition
algorithms are used in the signal processing and much of the skill of
the successful user comes from forming a conclusion from both the
radar image and a knowledge of target characteristics and soil
properties as well as external information.
GPR system loop dynamic range
GPR systems are regulated by national and international licensing
organizations such as ETSI [Europe], FCC [USA], OFCOM [UK] etc with
regard to the permitted radiated power levels and compliance with these
regulations is mandatory.
In terms of the power they can transmit, typically a GPR transmits
an average power less than a milliwatt [1.10-3 W] [3], [4]. In the UK the
maximum permitted power levels [EIRP] for GPR over the frequency
range 150 MHz to 4 GHz are as follows:
 Total radiated power:
≤250 microwatts
 Radiated spectral line power:
≤100 nanowatts
 Maximum leakage power from antenna shield: ≤10 nanowatts
The minimum signal that the receiver can detect lies between
picowatts [1.10-12 W] and femtowatts [1.10-15 W] depending on its
design. There are fundamental limitations to receiver sensitivity dictated
by the thermal noise of the receiver, its bandwidth as well as
environmental RF noise or clutter which set the limit to system loop
sensitivity. The ratio of the mean transmitted power and the minimum
detectable signal sets the overall system loop dynamic range of the
measurement system and this lies in the region of 108 to 1012 or
expressed in decibels 80 dB to 120 dB.
Physics of propagation
The strength of the received signal depends on the radar cross section
of the target and the losses encountered by the radar signal as it
propagates from the transmit antenna, couples into the ground, reflects
from the target and returns to the receive antenna. The radar cross
section of the target is defined by its physical size with respect to the
wavelengths propagating in the dielectric material. If the target is very
9

10

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

much smaller than the wavelength, it has a very small radar cross
section and consequently becomes vanishingly small. Other factors
affecting the signal level are related to the antenna efficiency in coupling
energy into the ground, the losses in the material (which are usually
expressed in dB per metre), and the way in which the transmitted signal
spreads out from its radiating antenna. In terms of power and in free
space and with respect to a point source radiator and target the signal
decreases in inverse proportion to the square of the range (target depth
or distance) and this is termed spreading loss. If the transmit and
receive antennas have directionality and hence gain, the signal will be
more concentrated in a particular direction and hence this may provide
a modest compensation for the effect of spreading loss. Although it is
possible to increase directionality by using coherent arrays of antennas,
the improvement is marginal and is not directly proportional to the
number of antennas in an array. It is not possible to improve
directionality to the point where spreading loss is eliminated.
Attenuation, Resolution, Bandwidth and Frequency
Free space radar systems need only consider propagation phenomena
through the atmosphere but waves propagating through other media
experience attenuation of both the electric (E) or magnetic (H) fields. The
graph in Fig. 2 shows the attenuation loss in dBs per metre plotted
against frequency in Hz for a material with a relative dielectric constant
of 9 and loss tangents of 0.005 to 0.1 respectively.

The impact of material attenuation on signal characteristics can be
seen from the following simulation. A Ricker wavelet is the second
differential of a Gaussian impulse and is typical of the radiated impulse
from a GPR. Transmitting this through a lossy material is equivalent to
passing through a low pass filter. The resulting effect on the time
domain signal and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The
source wavelet is the transmitted waveform and the output the received
waveform scaled by a factor of 2.94 and extended in time by 30%.
The effect on the spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 which shows the peak
of the spectrum shifted to lower frequencies and the higher frequencies
considerably reduced.

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The range resolution of GPR is generally set by the bandwidth of the
received signal. When a number of features may be present, a signal
having a larger bandwidth is required to be able to distinguish between
the various targets and to show the detailed structure of a target. In this
context it is the bandwidth of the received signal which is important,
rather than that of the transmitted wavelet. The soil acts a low pass
filter, which modifies the transmitted spectrum in accordance with the
electrical properties of the propagating medium. There are some
applications of GPR, such as road layer thickness measurement, where
the feature of interest is a single interface. Under such circumstances, it
is possible to determine the depth sufficiently accurately by measuring
the elapsed time between the leading edge of the received wavelet
provided the propagation velocity is accurately known. Although a
greater depth resolution is achieved in wetter materials for a given
transmitted bandwidth because of the reduced wavelength in high
dielectric materials, earth materials with significant water content tend
to have higher attenuation properties. This characteristic reduces the
effective bandwidth, tending to balance out the change so that within
certain bounds the resolution is approximately independent of loss
within the propagating material. Where interfaces are spaced more
closely than one half wavelength the reflected signal from one interface
will become difficult to resolve with that from another. It should be
noted that the normal Rayleigh criteria for range resolution is less
appropriate for the case of a weak target adjacent to strong target and
there is no accepted definition of resolution for the case of unequal size
targets [3].
The plan resolution is defined by the characteristics of the antenna
and the signal processing employed. In general, free space radar
systems (apart from SAR), require a high gain antenna to achieve an
acceptable plan resolution. This necessitates a sufficiently large
aperture at the lowest frequency which is to be transmitted. To achieve
small antenna dimensions and high gain therefore requires the use of a
high carrier frequency, which may not penetrate the material to
sufficient depth. When selecting equipment for a particular application
it is necessary to compromise between plan resolution, size of antenna,
the scope for signal processing and the ability to penetrate the material.
Plan resolution improves as attenuation increases, provided that there
is sufficient signal to discriminate under the prevailing clutter
conditions.
Clutter
A major difficulty for operation of GPR systems is the presence of clutter
within or on the surface of the material or in the side and back lobes of
the antenna. Clutter is defined as unwanted reflections that occur
within the effective bandwidth and search window of the radar and
present as spatially coherent reflectors. Animal burrows, cracks in the
12

12

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

ground are examples of features that will cause reflections. Careful
definition and understanding are critically important in selecting and
operating the best system and processing algorithms. Clutter can
completely obscure the buried target and a proper understanding of its
source and impact on the radar is essential. A key issue is the effect on
the signal of variations in the topography of the ground surface caused
by pothole or ruts. Methods of processing the radar signals that adjust
the delay time to the front surface to “flatten it” will actually distort the
radar signature of buried targets. Abrupt discontinuities can also cause
multiple reflections, which become superimposed on later arriving
reflected energy. Such “interference” will be extremely difficult to
remove.
Comparison of modulation techniques
A useful comparison of the relative performance of modulation
techniques has been carried out by Hamran [4] who showed that the
intrinsic performance of different types of radar modulation schemes is
related to the process by which the information in the reflected signal is
sampled. Ideally all the information should be sampled in one process,
whereas time domain and frequency domain systems employ a range of
down sampling techniques that are sub optimal. Assuming that the
system dynamic range [SDR] is fundamentally defined as the ratio
between the peak radiated power from the transmitting antenna and the
minimum detectable peak signal power entering the receiver antenna,
Hamran showed that different radar system could be analysed by
considering the average transmitted power and the receiver noise figure
provided the receiver is matched to the transmitted waveform. Where
this is not the case, a correction for mismatch loss needs to be
introduced. Hamran’s comparison assumed identical radiated power
spectral density, receiver integration times, antenna gains and receiver
noise figures at T = 300K, noise figure F = 5, system gain of G = 10, and
a signal to noise ratio of 25.
The limitations to the system performance are in Table 2.

From this it can be seen that the frequency domain radar systems
offer the greatest potential radar system loop dynamic range. However
the most common limitation that all modulation schemes suffer from is
the antenna coupling and ring down issue as well as receiver noise
figure.
Time domain systems
The majority of time domain radar systems use impulses of radio
frequency energy variously described as baseband, video, carrier-less,
impulse, monocycle or polycyclic. The radar is controlled by a master
clock, which after a suitable time delay triggers a pulse generator,
which generates pulses, typically of amplitude within the range between
10 V to 200 V with a pulse width within the range between 200 ps to 50
ns at a pulse repetition interval of between several hundred
microseconds to one microsecond or less, depending on the system
design, which are applied to the transmit antenna. It is quite feasible to
generate pulses of several hundred kV albeit at long repetition intervals.
A portion of the transmit signal is usually tapped off to provide an input
to the sampling control to ensure timing stability of the signals fed to
the sampling head. The radiated pulses propagate and are reflected
from the target and are received by the receive antenna.
The output from the receive antenna is applied either to a flash A/D
converter or a sequential sampling receiver. If the pulses are sufficiently
long duration (> 10 ns) and the radar repetition rate is slow (> 100 ms)
a flash A/D converter can be used. Where the pulses are shorter < 10
ns and the radar repetition rate is faster (< 100 ms), then a sequential
sampling receiver is used. Alternative methods of data acquisition are
based on high-speed analogue to digital converters or the cross
correlate receiver. There are several methods of acquiring the high
bandwidth RF signals output from the receiver; direct Analogue to
Digital conversion using high speed (flash) A-D converters, frequency
selection followed by high speed A-D conversion, or sequential
sampling.
The stability of the timing increment is very important and generally
this should be 10% of the sampling increment, however practically
stability in the order of 10 ps to 50 ps is achieved. The effect of timing
14

14

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

instability is to cause a distortion, which is related to the rate of change
of the RF waveform. Evidently, where the RF waveform is changing
rapidly, jitter in the sampling circuits results in a very noisy
reconstructed waveform. Where the rate of change of signal is slow,
jitter is less noticeable. Normally control of the sampling converter is
derived from a sample of the output from the pulse generator to ensure
that variations in the timing of the latter are compensated
automatically.
The key elements of this type of radar system are the impulse
generator, the timing control circuits, the sampling detector and the
peak hold and analogue to digital converter. The impulse generator is
generally based on the technique of rapid discharge of the stored energy
in a short transmission line. One method of achieving this is by means
of a transistor operated in avalanche breakdown mode used as the fast
switch and a very short length of transmission line. However the
avalanche process is statistical by nature and is accompanied by jitter
and step recovery diodes provide a much better jitter performance.
The high speed sampling approach conventionally used to display
fast waveforms produces a low S/N ratio because the spectrum of the
sampling pulse is a poor match for that of the received pulse. Being an
essentially non-selective filter, it allows large amounts of noise energy to
enter the receiver. Also, the sampling circuit tends to add milliamp level
unbalanced currents as well as sampling pulse noise to its output.
Although a quite acceptable trade off for usual laboratory purposes, this
may be unacceptable for receivers with sensitivity in the microvolt
range.
Frequency Domain systems – FMCW radar
An FMCW radar system transmits a swept carrier frequency by means
of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) over a chosen frequency range on
a repetitive basis. The received signal is mixed with a sample of the
transmitted waveform and results in a difference frequency which is
related to the phase of the received signal hence its time delay and
hence range of the target. The difference frequency or intermediate
frequency (IF) must be derived from an I/Q mixer pair if the information
equivalent to a time domain representation is required as a single ended
mixer only provides the modulus of the time domain waveform.
In essence, the FMCW radar measures the phase of the IF signal
which is directly related to target range. The frequency of the IF signal
can be regarded as a measure of range. An inverse complex frequencytime transform is used to reproduce a time domain equivalent to the
impulse radar, but most frequency domain radars display a signature
as shown in Fig. 5. The effect of windowing the IF waveform is
significant and the unwindowed case gives rise to the well-known sinc
(sin (x)/x) function. This limits the dynamic range of the receiver,
whereas a windowed case can potentially achieve a better dynamic
range albeit at the disadvantage of reduced resolution as shown in the

lower part of the graph. It can be seen that the close in sidelobes are
some -15 dB for the rectangular window and decrease to less than –40
dB for the Hamming window. This enables smaller targets close in range
to a larger target to be detected.
FMCW radar systems are particularly sensitive to certain
parameters; they requires a high degree of linearity of frequency sweep
with time to avoid spectral widening of the IF and hence degradation of
system resolution and practically a useful system should aim to keep all
non-linearities less than 0.1% and ideally less than 0.01% [5].
Linearisation of the sweep was traditionally achieved by three well
established methods; correction by means of an analogue correction for
a known non-linearity, a digital look up table to correct the measured
non-linearity and a dynamic correction technique using a delay line
discriminator. The main difficulty with the first two methods is that the
non-linearities are often temperature dependent, which then requires
either temperature stabilization of a measurement of device temperature
and a set of characteristics to cover the required temperature range.
This is easier to achieve with a digital look-up table.
The oscillators that provide the sweep for an FMCW may be
generated by a VCO which is driven by a voltage generated from a look
up table that is pre-compensated for non linearities or alternatively a
digital sweep generator produces a linear ramp signal using DDS
techniques that is applied to a coarse tuning port of a high frequency
tunable oscillator, such as a YIG tunable oscillator (YTO). A PLL has, as
its inputs, an accurate linear swept frequency sinusoid from a DDS and
a linear swept frequency output signal from the YTO to produce an
error correction signal that is applied to a fine-tuning port of the high
frequency tunable oscillator. The error correction signal compensates
for any non-linearities introduced into the linear swept frequency
output signal by the high frequency tunable oscillator.

Morgan et al. [6] compare the performance of a VCO and DDS and
the effect on the range performance and concludes that DDS solutions
offer better phase noise and better linearity, although spurious returns
at multiple range are some 20 dB higher than the VCO solution.
The leakage that occurs between the transmitter and receiver
antennas or via the circulator can have the unwanted effect of biasing
the mixer into saturation and hence cause a reduction in system
sensitivity and dynamic range. This problem can be partially solved by
using an additional path to introduce a phase cancellation to reduce the
leakage but this tends to be limited to narrower bandwidth systems.
Another unwanted effect that for large targets the phase noise of the
source then appears in adjacent range bins, completely saturating these
and dominating any return echoes from smaller targets. In the worst
case for close in targets this appears as radial lines on a PPI display and
can increase the noise level over all the range bins at that angle on the
display.
Other features of an FMCW radar system must also be considered.
Changes in VSWR of the microwave components over the range of swept
frequencies may cause "frequency pulling" of the transmit oscillator
unless high levels of isolation are built in. Changes in VSWR can be
caused by variations in antenna to sub reflector spacing or by changes
in the characteristics of components such as the circulator or mixer.
The amplitude-frequency transfer characteristics of all of the
components in an FMCW radar system should be substantially flat.
Ideally amplitude ripple levels should be less than ± 0.25 dB otherwise
the radiated waveform will exhibit an amplitude modulation which will
cause spectral spreading of the IF waveform with a resultant loss of
solution and system performance.
The greater dynamic range of the FMCW radar is a significant
advantage provided that the sweep linearity can be maintained and the
spectral broadening and sidelobes of the IF envelope minimized.
Frequency Domain systems – Stepped frequency radar
SFCW radar radiates a sequence of frequencies in regular increments
ranging over a defined bandwidth. Any repetitive pulsed signal can be
transformed to a frequency domain representation, which consists of
line spectra whose frequency spacing is related to the pulse repetition
rate and envelope is related to the pulse shape. Hence, a repetitive
impulsive waveform can be synthesized by transmitting individual
frequencies whose amplitude and phase is accurately specified. The
main advantages of the SFCW radar are its high dynamic range (> 100
dB) and low noise floor as well as the ability to avoid certain frequencies
when transmitting, thus making compliance with licensing and
interoperability requirements much easier than most other types of
modulation.

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The optimum step frequency signal for SFCW radar is described by
Cherniakov [7] who proposed that the optimum received signal is one
which results in an equal signal to noise ratio per spectral line taking
into account the soil losses. In effect the transmitted spectrum is
weighted to ensure that the SNR per spectral line is a constant. A
further extension of this proposition is to iteratively modify the
weighting of the transmitted spectrum at a limited number of spectral
lines to maximize the energy/SNR cost function.
Compared with time domain radar systems, SFCW radar offers the
potential advantages of greater dynamic range [= 30 dB], increased
mean output power [subject to license restrictions], spectral shaping
and high configurability particularly in terms of bandwidth and spectral
occupancy. Configurable spectral occupancy may well alleviate
compatibility issues related to operation physically adjacent to other
sources of EM radiation. Step frequency radar also offers the possibility
of calibrated compensation of antenna response. Other modulations
techniques such as COFDM, noise or pseudo random coded each have
limitations and hardware challenges that do not make them
immediately attractive. Even with an improved radar design it will still
be necessary to develop antennas more suited for vehicle applications
and with a rate of ring down better than the current design.
However, SFCW has a number of intrinsic design challenges which,
if not addressed, potentially limit its suitability as a ground penetrating
radar system. These are:
 speed of the transmission of the spectrum;
 settling time of the transmitted spectral lines;
 saturation of the receiver during the transmission of the spectral
lines;
 intermodulation and higher order mixing products in the receiver
mixer;
 system complexity;
 stability of system calibration;
 power consumption;
 signal processing.
Noise modulated systems
Noise modulated radar offers some very attractive possibilities to the
designer of GPR systems. The radiated power is evenly spread
throughout the spectrum and the receiver is less susceptible to
interference. However until recently such systems were relatively rare.
Developments over the last few years are changing that situation and
more efforts are being put into the development of noise radar systems.
The basic principle of operation of noise radar is that of a correlator.
The radar transmits a noise or Pseudo Random Coded signal and the
received signal is a time delayed version sof the transmitted signal. In
18

18

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

the receiver the transmitted signal is used via a variable delay v to
cross correlate the received signal. Some of the key design issues in
terms of noise radar are the ambiguity function and the range sidelobe
suppression. Dawood and Narayanan [8] consider the underlying issues
in terms of optimizing the ambiguity function. They developed an ultra
wideband (UWB) random noise radar system, which transmits an ultra
wideband random noise (Gaussian) waveform with uniform power
spectral density (PSD) in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. They showed
that for a random noise radar a correlator matched to the transmit
process is required and that for a UWB transmit random process, the
compression or stretch due to the range rate on the envelope of the
return process cannot be ignored.
The key issue for such correlator receivers becomes the sidelobe
levels which can have the unfortunate effect of masking weak signals by
the sidelobes of strong signals.
Spatially modulated systems
Single frequency methods of imaging are based on the technique of
viewing the target from a number of physically different positions in an
aperture over the target and recording the amplitude and phase of the
received signal and then mathematically reconstructing an image of the
target. The process may be either holographic, whereby the recorded
field represents the scattered field at a plane or tomographic, whereby
the recorded field is that of the transmitted field through the target at
all angles of view.
The drawbacks to the process are that accurate positioning of the
antenna elements is required and this usually involves mechanical
positioning of either the transmitter and receiver elements or both. The
accuracy of measurement in terms of amplitude and phase are key
factors in the quality of the image reconstruction. This imposes a
practical limitation on operational situations, but may be useful either
where the position of the target can be controlled or the target can be
viewed at all sides as in a tomographic image. Where the target has
multiple layers of different velocities of propagation, as might be the
case for a human, the solution of the forward propagating wave paths
as a function of view angle is non-trivial.
The differences between optical holography and radar holography
appear to lie in the way in which the wave field is recorded. In the case
of the optical hologram the image plane comprises the forward scattered
field as shown in Fig. 6. In the case of radar system the recorded field
comprises the backscattered field and this may of course not be the
same as the forward scattered field.
The effect of material attenuation is significant as the general effect
is to apply a windowing function across the recording aperture thus
limiting its useful size in relation to sharply focused images as shown in
Fig. 7.

TUD COST Action TU1208

In addition, the effect of both material attenuation and relative
permittivity on the antenna beamwidth should be considered. As the
values of loss and relative permittivity increase the beamwidth of the
antenna reduces and this degrades the gain of the synthetic aperture.
In general, synthetic aperture methods are most useful in lower loss
materials.
Reference [9] notes that holographic radar receives a signal
amplitude that decreases with the range law and material attenuation
hence penetration depth depends on the attenuation in the surveying
medium, and the target reflectivity with the added complication that
targets at short range will obscure targets at deeper range in the
recorded images. This phenomena may be exploited as the ability to
detect targets at very short ranges is far better than conventional GPR
systems.

III. ANTENNA DESIGN CHALLENGES
Introduction
GPR antennas are generally operated in three distinct modes with
respect to the ground surface.
A. Those operated close [< 10 cm] to the ground surface, usually
with a zero angle of incidence could be termed “Proximal
antennas”.
B. Those operated 0.1-1m from the ground surface, usually with a
zero angle of incidence could be termed “Close in antennas”.
C. Those operated > 5m from the ground surface usually at a slant
angle could be termed “Standoff antennas”.
GPR is generally operated so that the antenna is very close to the
ground surface such that the energy transfer is predominantly either in
the induction or quasi-stationary radiation region (the near field). Some
workers have reported detection by means of evanescent wave
propagation and it may also be possible to exploit lateral waves. When
the antenna is closely coupled into a dielectric the radiation
characteristics of the antenna is affected to a considerable extent and
the pattern in the dielectric is different to that in free space. The
propagation path consists in general of a lossy, inhomogeneous
dielectric, which, in addition to being occasionally anisotropic, exhibits
a frequency dependent attenuation and hence acts as a low pass filter.
The upper frequency of operation of the antenna, and hence the
GPR system, is therefore limited by the properties of the material. The
need to obtain a high value of range resolution often requires the
antenna to exhibit ultra-wide bandwidth, and in the case of impulsive
radar systems, linear phase response.

21

21

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The requirement for wide bandwidth and the limitation in upper
frequency performance are mutually conflicting and hence a design
compromise is adopted whereby antennas are designed to operate over
some portion of the frequency range 10 MHz to 5 GHz depending on the
resolution and range specified.
Stand-off GPR systems can be operated such that the energy
transfer is in the far field region and this in turn brings challenges of
energy transfer and above ground clutter rejection.
There are a number of requirements for frequency independent
operation and these are as follows:
Excitation of the antenna from the region of the antenna from which
high frequencies are radiated.
 A transmission region formed by the inactive part of the antenna
between the feed point and the active region. This zone should
produce negligible far field radiation.
 An active region from which the antenna radiates strongly
because of an appropriate combination of current magnitude and
phases.
 An inactive region created by means of reflection or absorption
beyond the active region. It is essential that there is a rapid decay
of currents beyond the active region. Efficient antennas achieve
this by means of radiation in the active region whereas the less
efficient use resistive loading techniques to achieve this
characteristic.
 A geometry defined entirely by angles i.e., the biconical dipole,
conical spiral, planar spiral maintain their performance over a
frequency range defined entirely by their limiting dimensions,
subject to an extended impulse response.
The two general types of antenna that are useful to the designer of
GPR fall into two groups: non-dispersive antennas and dispersive
antennas. Examples of non-dispersive antennas are the TEM Horn, the
bicone, the bow-tie, the resistive, lumped element loaded antenna or the
resistive, continuously loaded antenna. Examples of dispersive
antennas that have been used in GPR are the Exponential spiral, the
Archimedean spiral, the logarithmic planar antenna, the Vivaldi
antenna and the exponential horn.
Element antennas such as monopoles, dipoles, conical antennas
and bow-tie antennas have been widely used for GPR applications.
Generally they are characterized by linear polarization, low directivity
and relatively limited bandwidth, unless either end loading or
distributed loading techniques are employed in which case bandwidth is
increased at the expense of radiation efficiency.
Various arrangements of the element antenna have been used such
as the parallel dipole and the crossed dipole, which is an arrangement
that provides high isolation and detection of the cross-polar signal from
linear reflectors.

FIG. 8 – Impulse response of an antenna to an applied Gaussian input.

A typical antenna used in an impulse radar system would be
required to operate over a frequency range of a minimum of an octave
and ideally at least a decade, for example, 100 MHz - 1 GHz. All of the
antennas used to date have a limited low frequency performance unless
compensated and hence act as band pass filters, thus the current input
to the antenna terminals is radiated as a differentiated version of the
input function. In general it is reasonable to consider that the far field
radiated electric field is proportional to the derivative of the antenna
current.
The input voltage driving function to the terminals of the antenna in
an impulse radar is typically a Gaussian pulse. The impulse response of
the antenna is required to be short because it is important that the
antenna does generate time sidelobes. These would obscure weaker
targets that are close in range to the target of interest, hence both the
resolution and detection performance of the radar can become degraded
if the impulse response of the antenna is significantly extended. If the
antenna is considered to be a bandpass filter then an examination of
the impulse response illustrates the issue. In Fig. 8 the output response
of a typical antenna is modelled using a 22 coefficient Hamming FIR
filter and a 10th order IIR Butterworth filter with their respective low
and high frequency cutoff values set to mimic a typical loaded dipole
response. The impulse response plotted on a linear scale is typical of
many GPR systems and at first sight looks acceptable , however if the
impulse response is plotted on a dB scale as shown in Fig. 9 then the
issue of time sidelobes becomes immediately obvious.

FIG. 9 – Impulse response of an antenna to an applied Gaussian input
plotted in dB.

The energy stored in the antenna decays gradually and hence limits
the detection of targets at greater range that are subject to attenuation
and spreading loss. Hence the GPR has a limit to detection performance
that is set by the slope of the time sidelobe rate of decay.
The requirement for portability for the operator means that it is
normal to use electrically small antennas, which consequently result
generally in a low gain and associated broad radiation patterns. Valle et
al. [10] considered the theoretical and experimental directivity functions
for antennas for ground penetrating radar. The classes of antennas that
can be used are therefore limited, and the following factors have to be
considered in the selection of a suitable design; large fractional
bandwidth, low time sidelobes and in the case of separate transmit and
receive antennas, low cross coupling levels. The interaction of the
reactive field of the antenna with the dielectric material and its effect on
antenna radiation pattern characteristics must also be considered.
Range or Time sidelobes
The observation about the time sidelobes is also relevant to frequency
domain systems as unless the energy in the transmitted waveforms
packet can be constrained in time or range the result is a radar that is
unable to detect targets with a small radar cross section at longer
ranges or time in the presence of a larger target such as the ground
surface.

Most antennas have a rate of ringdown in the order of 10 dB per
nanosecond, but if this could be increased to 20 dB per nanosecond the
GPR detection performance would be usefully improved. This is
therefore a topic worth further research and development and would
radically improve GPR performance.
Coupling into the soil
Most antennas are designed to have a radiation impedance near to that
of free space which has a characteristic impedance of 377 . Many soils
has a frequency dependent characteristic impedance which lies in the
range of 50 to 200 and the variability of the ground impedance is a
source of variable loading and mismatch as well as a poor power
transfer. For proximal operation could a low impedance aperture reduce
the effect of ground loading and mismatch effects? While this was
considered many years ago with H field antennas, perhaps further
consideration could be given to methods of improving the efficiency of
energy transfer. Assuming that the wideband performance can be
maintained, are techniques such as focusing using 2 layer Double
Negative materials with < 0, < 0 as described by Engheta and
Ziolkowski [11] worth investigating.
Multiple reflections between the antenna and the soil
When the antenna is some tens of centimeters above the ground there
is a need to reduce the reflection seen by the reflected wave when it
returns and meets the receive antenna. This situation is the cause of
multiple reflections between the antenna aperture and the ground
surface.

FIG. 10 – DNG slab lens with negative refractive index materials
 = -1 and = -6.

25

25

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

For standoff and close in operation could a high impedance aperture
make the antennas apertures partially invisible to the incoming wave
and hence reduce multiple reflections? Alternatively could novel
absorbing screen techniques aid in reducing multiple reflections
between the ground and the antenna?
Engheta proposed a thin absorbing screen [in contrast to a l/4
Salisbury screen] comprised of a metamaterial with high surface
impedance [R = +1] based on a dielectric layer backed by a conductive
ground plane on which is placed a thin resistive sheet as a means of
reducing back reflections.
A further possibility in antenna design particularly for resistively
loaded antennas in proximal operation is to adapt the resistive loading
to the material impedance by changing the resistive loading of the
antenna using MEM switches. This might improve GPR performance
with respect to antenna ringdown and multiple reflections.
Optimization of antenna characteristics
In addition to the issues referred to in the previous sections,
environmental clutter is also a limitation that is predominantly caused
by lack of directivity and the associated back and sidelobe levels from
most antennas. Therefore methods of minimizing back and sidelobes
levels are a useful area of for further development. As an example
consider a 3 mm long monopole antenna mounted on a 50 mm ground
plane operating at 35 GHz as described by Sievenpiper et al. [12]. The
use of a high impedance surface radically reduce the surface waves that
radiate at the edges of the ground plane and provide a much better
radiation pattern. The challenge is to achieve this improvement over a
wide bandwidth and one of the issue with forbidden band approaches is
the limitation this implies in terms of frequency. In addition to
improvements in radiation performance the use of high impedance
surfaces may also enable smaller antenna to be designed.

Single antenna versus dual antennas
The majority of GPR systems use two antennas, one for transmit and
one for receive, because apart from a few applications, the very short
time ranges provide a major challenge to the antenna and system
designer. A single antenna is potentially more attractive because it
reduces the size of the GPR and minimizes some of the deficiencies
associated with dual antennas. However, in order to use a single
antenna, certain design requirements need to be met. The receiver
needs to be isolated from the transmit pulse and in a conventional
radar this is achieved using a T/R switch. However for GPR the
switching times need to be sub nanosecond if real time operation is
required and the requirements for high isolation and low switching
breakthrough are very demanding. Because of this situation very few
GPRs use a single antenna with a T/R switch for short range
applications. There is therefore an opportunity to develop such a
component or an alternative way of operating with a single antenna.
Alternatives to using a T/R switch are often found in the frequency
domain where a circulator is used and in the time domain where a
precision RF bridge/coupler is used to provide isolation between the
receiver and the transmit signal/pulse by virtue of the high directivity of
the precision RF bridge/coupler.

x scale 1000 mm, y scale 1000 mm.
Simulations of a single antenna and dual antenna GPR using a
point target are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.
The key differences between the two are as follows; the dual antenna
GPR creates a hyperbolic spreading function which is narrower than the
single antenna GPR by virtue of the separation between the elements.
The amplitude of the received signal from the target is marginally
greater by 10% in the case of the single antenna GPR although the auto
scaling of the graphs has emphasized the visual difference. However the
inherent isolation of the dual antenna GPR is much greater than the
single antenna GPR and in order the achieve the same detection
performance the single antenna GPR has to process the received A scan
such that the internal reflections from the antenna and the reflection
from the ground surface is reduced by at least -45 dB which the
28

28

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

simulation includes. Some of this might be achieved by good matching
of the antenna s11 parameter but a reduction of the reflection from the
ground surface by at least -45 dB is demanding. It should also be noted
that the single antenna configuration minimizes the duration of the
energy associated with the reflection from the ground surface and
antenna coupling in the dual antenna case due to the reduction of the
associated time delays.
Array antennas
Vehicle based or airborne systems use much larger arrays of antennas
to illuminate a swathe of the ground surface ahead of the platform and
rely on the movement of the vehicle to create the down track data,
which is single pass. Both the down track and cross track data may be
processed using SAR techniques. Where the antenna elements are
relatively close to the ground, the path losses encountered by off nadir
elements may limit the SAR gain that can be achieved. As the array
elements are generally fixed in position, changes in ground topography
in both cross track and down track affect the path propagation and
influence the type of signal processing that can be applied. This is
illustrated in Fig. 7 and places an inherent limit on SAR performance
for close in antenna array configurations. It may be worth considering a
partial SAR process whereby only sub arrays are used.

IV. SIGNAL PROCESSING
Signal processing is primarily a means of reducing clutter.
Fundamentally, the signal to clutter ratio of the radar data is the key to
target detection. Most system noise in GPR systems can be reduced by
averaging. GPR is heavily contaminated by clutter and reduction of this
is a key objective.
The cost-benefit of implementation should be clearly demonstrated
before superficially attractive but practically unsound methods are
incorporated. Clearly, the wide range of targets, applications and
situations encountered is likely to task even the most robust algorithm
and the user should assess the real benefit of latest algorithm with
some care.
The general objective of signal processing as applied to GPR is to
present either an image that can readily be interpreted by the operator
or to classify the target return with respect to a known test procedure or
template.
The image of a buried target generated by a GPR radar will not, of
course, correspond to its geometrical representation and this fact needs
to be made clear to those considering the use of GPR but who are
unfamiliar with the physics. The fundamental reasons for this are
related to the ratio of the wavelength of the radiation and the physical
29

29

30

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

dimensions of the target. In most cases for GPR the ratio is close to
unity. This compares very differently with an optical image, which is
obtained with wavelengths such that the ratio is considerably greater
than unity.
In GPR applications, the effect of combinations of scattering planes,
for example, the corner reflector, can cause “bright spots” in the image
and variations in the velocity of propagation can cause dilation of the
aspect ratio of the image. While many images can be focused to reduce
the effect of antenna beam spreading, re-generation of a geometric
model is a much more complex procedure and cost benefit of the
exercise should be very carefully examined.
The main signal processing methods used in GPR are shown in Fig.
15, Fig. 16 and Fig. 17. Wavelet deconvolution or “spiking” may be an
area of investigation worth further effort.
It is worth noting that practically most robust processing techniques
are limited in the improvement they can achieve in other than very
carefully controlled conditions.

The remains of buildings are completely inhomogeneous, comprising
multiple reflectors at different angles, voids and a topography of the
front surface that limits the application of standard signal processing
techniques. However Doppler radar systems have been extensively
investigated for the detection of the victims of earthquakes as reported
by Aggelopoulos et al. [13], Boric-Lubecke et al. [14], Chen et al. [15],
Droitcour et al. [16], [17], Lohman et al. [18], Lubecke et al. [19], Lin
[20]-[22], Park et al. [23], Xiao et al. [24] and Zhou et al. [25] who all
describe various systems and experimental results. The velocities of
typical human actions are 0.45 ms-1 for movement of the heart and
0.01ms-1 for breathing. At 1 GHz the Doppler frequency for human
breathing is less than 0.1 Hz and this low frequency poses challenges
for the design and operation of the radar in that it must remain very
stable and noise free while measurements are being taken. In addition
the signal generated by observers and detected in the back lobes of the
antenna may be larger than that of the subject. Standard GPR is
therefore not immediately suitable because its inherent high range
resolution will encounter high levels of clutter, however if a GPR is able
to process the Doppler information from targets, this will be means of
drastically reducing the clutter levels and enable the detection of those
victims who may still be alive.
Landmines
Landmines and improvised explosive devices [IEDs] are devices used to
frustrate and slow down the maneuverability of military forces; their
effect is also to deny civilians access to agricultural land and their
means of livelihood. The injuries suffered by those maimed by these
weapons are traumatic and in spite of the Ottawa Treaty their use and
deployment continues. Generally these weapons are inexpensive to
manufacture and emplace, and those deploying these weapons have an
inherent economic and tactical advantage over those detecting and
neutralizing them. The challenge in both military and civilian situations
is to be able to detect and neutralize these weapons at an economic
cost, and understand the networks that facilitate their deployment.
Many of the landmines and IEDs encountered in affected countries are
metallic mines, but some proportion of plastic or minimum metallic
mines and IEDs can be found in a variety of countries and terrains and
have proven to be highly effective at inhibiting the operation of
conventional forces, because they are difficult to detect. GPR has been
used very successfully for handheld applications for both humanitarian
and military landmine and IED clearance [26]. In humanitarian
applications, there is similar interest in use of robots for clearance of
mine-affected land, although for now, mine clearance is still carried out
by hand. Recent trials by HALO in Cambodia using a hand-held dualsensor system (GPR and metal detector) have demonstrated that it is
possible to achieve a 90% reduction in false identifications compared

with a metal detector alone. This is a key benefit of GPR, since it
increases the rate of clearance, which is allows more land to be put
back to productive use or returned to the local inhabitants of mine
affected areas. Although GPR for landmine technology is mature, it is
capable of further development to enable continued classification of
evolving targets and continued reduction of the size, weight and power
of equipment.
One potential application lies in the use of GPR mounted on small
UAV's for use in areas such as roads where vegetation does not
significantly obscure the ground. GPR systems have been developed for
standoff operation mounted on unmanned airborne or vehicle platforms
but payload and navigation issues proved a limitation in the past. In the
airborne case initial proving trials in a manned aircraft showed that
pattern minefields in dry sandy conditions could be imaged from
heights of several hundred meters at 400 knots, whereas for vehicle
based applications the low grazing angles limit standoff range to some
tens of meters for shallowly buried targets. Airborne GPR is already
used for the survey of glaciers where quite compact and lightweight
radars have been
developed. Recent developments in miniature
navigation and control systems offer the prospect of improved flight
control and navigation. An example of a system for search and rescue
applications is given by Erdos et al. [27] who successfully integrated
sensors, navigation and communications sub systems into a
commercially available RC aircraft. The challenge was to search an area
3 km by 4 km and deliver a 500 ml bottle of water close to the target
and the project successfully completed the practice, qualification and
tuning flight phase.
Such system capability may be appropriate for the GPR survey of
roads for landmines provided both GPR sensors and accurate height
keeping radar can be developed and integrated into robust flight
platforms.

VI. GROUND TRUTH AND CONFIDENCE
Many publications relating to GPR provide limited statistical
information relating to ground truth and target detection performance
and a greater emphasis on this aspect of GPR would benefit the
technique. In the case of an initial test of the GPR, the position and
identity of buried targets should be hidden from the operator, so that
clues are not inadvertently revealed by either ground sign or the test
administrators. This is routinely done in the case of GPR for landmine
detection and road condition assessment. In the case of geological
features or roads, a robust method of assessing the performance of GPR
against known phenomena must be a precursor to acceptance of
performance claims. This would normally include the comparison of
GPR results with those obtained by borehole data without the release of
32

the latter information to the GPR operator or data analyst until after the
GPR interpreted results and the borehole interpreted results are
delivered to an independent third party for comparison (double-blind).
A well designed test will use a variety of stratagems to ensure the
GPR operator cannot obtain visual clues from disturbed surfaces to
infer the position of target(s) when data are processed. The GPR
operator may wish to ascribe levels of confidence in classifying targets
rather than a simple yes or no decision. Once the test data is available
it should be analyzed in standard ways as described below.
Key parameters in assessing the performance of any detection
system is its Probability of Detection (PD), the Probability of False Alarm
(PFA) as well as the confidence that can be placed in the claimed PD
and PFA. A standard method of describing the behavior of any process
is based on an extension of basic statistical testing embodied in the
term “receiver operating characteristic” [ROC] which originated from
tests of the ability of World War II radar operators to determine whether
a blip on the radar screen represented an object (signal), clutter or
noise.
The ROC curve is another way of understanding the performance of
a sensor and plots the true positive rate as a function of the true
negative rate for different levels of sensitivity of the sensor. For example
consider two populations, one due to true reports or detections and one
due to false alarms, which are shown in Fig. 1 and labelled true and
false respectively.
Their Gaussian population distributions have identical standard
deviations, but different mean values. If a receiver detection threshold
value were set to 5 then the majority of the true positive reports would
be detected and a small proportion of true negative (false positive)
reports would be included.

This threshold can also be plotted as a pair of true positive/true
negative reports or sometimes termed sensitivity/specificity parameters
and this generates a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The
ROC curve for Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2 and it can be seen that at a 0.95
true positive detection the false positive proportion is 0.1.
A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two
distributions) has a ROC plot that passes through the upper left corner
(100% sensitivity, 100% specificity).
Therefore the closer the ROC plot is to the upper left corner, the
higher the overall accuracy of the test.
The size of the sample must also be known in order to determine a
confidence level in the result.
Elementary statistical sampling theory can be used to show that the
confidence that can be placed in a test of a limited sample set is
fundamentally related to the size of the sample set. If 10 tests are
carried out on an equipment and even if all provide a positive report (a
probability of detection of 100%), the statistical confidence in the claim
is limited by the number in the set. At the 95% limit, the upper and
lower confidence bounds can be derived from the Binomial Distribution
and these are respectively 1 and 0.7.
In essence the smaller the data set, the less statistical confidence
that can be ascribed to the results. At least 100 tests must be carried
out to achieve a statistical confidence of 95% for a claimed Probability of
Detection of 97%.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
Although GPR technology is mature, it is capable of further
development to enable continued classification of evolving targets and
continued reduction of the size, weight and power of equipment.
New antenna designs and modulation techniques, will allow a
greater breadth of capability and performance in the future. Indeed,
recent developments in so-called meta-materials and advanced
computer modelling techniques offer considerable promise in
miniaturization of high efficiency antennas. Some areas for further
development could be:
 optimization of system loop dynamic range;
 development
of
wideband
components
such
as
TR
switches/precision couplers/bridges to enable single antenna
operation;
 improvements in antenna rate of energy decay or ringdown to
improve both resolution and detection performance;
 adaptive wideband antennas to optimize energy transfer to the
material;
 wideband antennas with improved back and sidelobe
performance;
 opportunities for higher rates or survey using UAV platforms;
 further development of UWB/Doppler GPR for the detection of
victims of avalanches.

Abstract
The European GPR Association (EuroGPR) grew originally out of the UK based
Impulse Radar Users Group, primarily in response to issues arising from using
transmitting devices in a world where many types of transmitting devices were
beginning to proliferate.
It became quickly apparent that the issues raised applied to all of Europe
and, alongside It became quickly apparent that the issues raised the restrictions
imposed by FCC regulation in the States, that a Europe-wide licensing regime
was in the interest of all GPR users and manufacturers.
The Association was actively involved in developing the current licensing
regulations and in contributing technical advice to European regulatory bodies
such as ETSI and RSComm. It also developed and adapted its own Code of
Practice which is now mandatory on all GPR users within Europe.
As use of GPR has grown, the activities of the organization have expanded
as has the number, nationality and variety of members. The main aims of the
organization are now to promote and support all legitimate use of the technology
and to develop professionalism, training and standards in its use.
Current activities include the building of a substantial virtual library,
development of training modules, liaison with other professional bodies and
governmental organizations and the provision of technical advice to counteract
misleading and inappropriate technological claims which might bring the
technology into disrepute. Future aims include the formation of national
Association groups capable of tackling local issues as well as responding to
European co-operation.

GROUND PENETRATING RADAR MODELLING: THE STORY SO FAR
A. Giannopoulos
University of Edinburgh, School of Engineering
A.Giannopoulos@ed.ac.uk

Abstract
The ability to model the physical response of systems that we use to sense the
environment, either manmade or natural, is fundamental in increasing our
understanding about its condition and makeup and allows us to make important
decisions in developing methodologies and approaches for its preservation,
remediation, maintenance and exploration. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is
one of the most advanced tools that are often used – especially in engineering
applications – to amass high resolution, albeit complex, information about a
great range of opaque objects of interest and the shallow subsurface.
In our efforts to make sense of the complex information carried in the GPR
data simulation of the underlying process of detection is a powerful tool in
enhancing our understanding and often in guiding us to better interpretations. In
the road to more quantitative GPR analyses that include automated imaging and
data driven inversion approaches, efficient GPR simulation has a central role. As
computer technologies accelerate and become widely available the next steps
which, could include more practical use of GPR modelling, seem to be in sight.
This talk will try to provide a brief overview of GPR simulation and its
progress over the last twenty years focusing on the development of GPRMAX, a
free finite-difference time-domain tool that is used to simulate the GPR’s
response. It will present some examples of what it is possible with the
availability of high performance computing and briefly cover some developments
for increasing its capabilities. It aims to conclude with some ideas for the future
and outline the directions for possible advances in this field.

Abstract
Today the site of the Roman town of Carnuntum, located some 30 km south-east
of Austria’s capital Vienna, is to a large extent covered with agriculturally used
fields, offering over some 10 square kilometres access to a unique cultural
heritage landscape using non-invasive archaeological prospection methods. For
the past 20 years Carnuntum has been the testing ground for high-resolution
archaeological prospection methods developed by the Viennese research group
Archeo Prospections® in collaboration with the University of Vienna, covering in
total circa one square kilometre of survey area. Aside from large-scale manual
magnetic prospection surveys conducted with highly sensitive Caesium
magnetometers, earth resistance measurements as well as detailed groundpenetrating radar (GPR) measurements since 1997, the Forum of the civil town
of Carnuntum, located in a horse paddock, has served in 2005 as test area for a
detailed comparison of available single channel GPR systems. The
establishment of the European Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological
Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Vienna in 2010 has provided the basis to
extend the earlier fundamental research into Carnuntum using latest
archaeological prospection technology and methodology, testing and applying
remote sensing methods as well as novel high-resolution motorized prospection
systems, such as several different multichannel GPR arrays and magnetometer
systems for large-scale prospection. The systematic use of high-resolution GPR
prospection in combination with remote sensing methods and magnetometry has
amongst others resulted in the unique discovery of the school of gladiators of
Carnuntum, first mapped with a single channel 900 MHz GPR system, and
subsequently investigated in great detail using a multichannel 400 MHz array
with only 8 cm crossline spacing. This discovery was a crucial factor in 2011 for
gaining financial support permitting the area-wide prospection of the entire town
of Carnutum in a 3-year prospection project. Between 2012 and 2015 the entire
town of Carnuntum, comprising the civil town as well as the military camp and
settlement are being mapped in great detail using non-invasive prospection
methods. High-resolution GPR measurements are of fundamental importance for
the detection, mapping, documentation and investigation of the buried cultural
heritage in three dimensions.

Abstract
The TU1208 Action focuses on the exchange of scientific-technical knowledge
and experience of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques in Civil
Engineering. One of the main topics in the Action, therefore, concerns the design
and optimisation of novel equipment to provide a step ahead with respect to the
current technology. This paper reports on the state-of-the-art and on the possible
developments that can be expected in the near future.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The use of GPR in Civil Engineering is well known and there are several
applications where it is currently utilised; they include the location of
buried services, the detection voids or cavities, locating steel
reinforcement in concrete, geotechnical foundation investigations, as
well as archaeological, environmental and hydrogeological surveys.
Continuous inspection of layers in road pavements and airport runways
also requires an effective tool capable of providing quality control on
engineering construction projects.
Requirements for these applications are different and each one
imposes a particular set of constraints on the design of an effective
GPR.
For example, the majority of buried plant is within 1.5 to 2 metres of
the ground surface, but it may have a wide variation in its size, may be
metallic or non-metallic, may be in close proximity to other plant and
may be buried in a wide range of soil types, with implications for large
47

differences in both the absorption and the velocity of propagation of
electromagnetic waves, and consequent effects upon GPR performance.
For this application, the most important performance criterion is
depth of penetration, with resolution (the ability to distinguish between
closely space objects), whilst being important, is a secondary
consideration.
On the contrary, survey of concrete or asphalt pavements requires
very high resolution for accurately measuring the thickness of layers
composing roadways or the runways; the same applies to the
assessment of bridge decks where GPR signals can be analysed to
detect potentially corroded areas.
Performance characteristics of GPRs are also often affected by
ground conditions may that may vary rapidly within the area of a radar
survey where, for example, variations in water content can be crucial
and, particularly in urban areas, where there could be imported backfill
of inconsistent quality.
Consequently, it can be sometime problematic to achieve both
adequate penetration of the radar energy and good resolution, and some
design compromises may have to be accepted.
In addition, a further issue concerns the interpretation of GPR data,
which is not trivial in many situations; in this respect, the latest
developments in GPR are oriented towards the design of equipment
featuring real-time 3D high resolution images of surveyed areas.

An image like the one shown in Fig.1 is easily understandable even
by a not skilled operator; however, this visualisation improvement can
be effective only if the GPR performs well in terms of signal quality and
detection range; in fact, if the received signal is too weak, as would be
the case in wet, muddy ground, enhanced graphic software will solve
neither the basic signal problem nor the detection performance.
Thus, the approach to be followed in the TU1208 Cost Action should
address both the basic radar signal detection problem (which can be
extremely challenging) and the aesthetics of the display.

II. TIME DOMAIN GPR
Ground Penetrating Radars are designed to probe up to a few metres
into the ground through material that is, usually, non-homogenous
and, unlike free-space, strongly absorbs radar signals. The frequency
range that has been found to be useful for such an application lies
within the limits of 100 MHz to 2 GHz.
Usually, the means of producing a transmit signal with the required
frequency range is by an impulse generator based upon an avalanche
transistor. A typical pulse obtained from such a device is shown below,
together with its spectrum (note that the signal consists of just a single
cycle with a period of, approximately, 10 nanoseconds, as shown in the
diagram below). Although this is a cost-effective means of producing a
signal with usable characteristics, the physical mechanism is a random
process that may produce noise and jitter, thus limiting the inherent
dynamic range of the system.

The receivers for such systems are based upon the methods used in
high frequency time domain sampling oscilloscopes which also have
fundamental limits on their dynamic range, that rarely exceeds 70 dB.
The diagram below depicts a typical GPR system, consisting of an
impulse source and receiver connected by transmission lines to
transmit and receive antennas. The system is deployed close to the
ground surface, and interactions occur between the radar and the
ground and between its internal components. The major interaction
paths are marked.
These interactions are extended in time and define what is known as
the “Impulse Response” of the system. It is also known as the “Clutter
Profile”. This is shown below in the next diagram as a decaying received
signal - with respect to time and hence distance from the radar.
Reflections from targets buried in the ground must be large enough for
their peaks to be visible above the clutter profile. The system clutter
profile is a critical system performance parameter and the radar must
be designed to maximise its delay and to make it, as far as possible,
independent of the electrical properties of the ground.

III. FREQUENCY DOMAIN GPR
Frequency domain radar systems have as long a history as their time
domain counterparts. For some applications, the advantages of simple
Continuous Wave (CW) systems is that they avoid the complication of
modulation circuitry, have no minimum or maximum range as well as
maximising power on the target.

FIG. 4  Consequent GPR clutter response.

However, because they depend upon the Doppler shift principle they
also have the disadvantage of only being able to detect moving targets.
The main use of such systems has been military, where they provide a
means of determining the point of closest approach by guided weapons
to their targets so that the warheads may be detonated at the correct
time.
Being unable to detect targets unless they are moving and
producing a Doppler shift clearly makes CW radars unsuitable for
GPRs.
If, however, the source is able to produce a range of frequencies
continuously varying with time, then it is possible to detect targets that
do not move. Such radars are known as Swept Frequency Continuous
Wave (SFCW). Usually the signal is generated by a source whose
frequency can be controlled by the application of an external DC
voltage.
In both the generation and reception of frequency domain signals,
the technology is very different from that their time domain
counterparts, and some aspects of the performance of such systems,
particularly noise and dynamic range, are superior.

FIG. 5  FMCW radar with I and Q outputs schematic diagram.

In fact, each measurement is made at a constant frequency and,
hence, the output of the both the In-Phase and Quadrature mixers is a
constant voltage.
Because both Local Oscillator signals are coherent with the received
signal, the output of the mixers is proportional to the difference in
phase between the transmitted and received signals, but the difference
frequency cannot exist because there is no change in frequency.
In this sense, it is a CW radar and, technically, is termed a
homodyne system.
By the application of a command, usually issued by a digital system,
the frequency of the microwave source can be changed to a new value
and, after allowing for the settling time, another CW measurement made
where the mixer outputs are proportional to the phase difference
between the transmit and receive signals at the new frequency.
As the microwave source is systematically “stepped”, in equal
increments, through its complete frequency range, the DC voltages from
both mixers are digitised and stored.
At the completion of the process, the record of the voltages of the
mixers (which are proportional to change in phase of the received
signals, with respect to the transmitted signal) may be displayed as a
function of frequency of the transmitted signal. The result is
indistinguishable from the difference frequency that would have been
obtained from the continuously swept source.
52

The advantage gained from the extra complication of a stepped
frequency source is that the transmitted CW signals are extremely
stable and spectrally pure to a degree that cannot be obtained from a
continuously swept source.

IV. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN TU1208 WORKING GROUP 1
The WG1 of the TU1208 focuses on the design, realization and testing of
innovative GPR equipment dedicated for civil engineering applications.
The synergy with other WGs is a key aspect as it helps in deeply
understanding the problems, merits and limits of currently available
GPR equipment.
Even this activity is still at the early beginning, two main research
axes can be already identified; these are
 the increase of the sensitivity (thus the dynamic range ) of GPR
systems, to enable the usability in a wider range of conditions;
 the development of antenna arrays to increase the amount and
quality of data collected on-site. Sought enhancements shall
concern the selection of the optimal working frequency and
bandwidth, according to the characteristics of the targets of
interest, as well as of the best waveform to be generated by the
radar antennas.
In this subsection the concept of reconfigurable Ground Penetrating
Radar for the increasing of dynamic range is introduced. The idea to
reconfigure an electromagnetic system has been imported from the
communication systems, where it can be of interest to have the
possibility to switch among two or more different antenna beams
(differently directed) and/or two or more different work bands, in order
to face some possible propagation problem within one of the band,
because e.g. of some fading or particular noise/interfering signals.
The idea to translate the reconfigurability within the context of the
GPR systems dates back to 2008 [1]. The reconfigurability is meant as
the possibility to change (or at least to switch) some parameters of the
system vs. the frequency in a programmable way. This can help in
equalize the answer of the system and extend the comprehensive
exploitable band, meant both in terms of impedance and antenna
pattern.
Moreover, if applied to a stepped frequency system the
reconfigurability can be also exploited in order to prolong the integration
time of the generated harmonics in a selective way, so to reject strong
narrow band interferences and increase the dynamic range. An early
prototype of stepped frequency system has been recently implemented,
within
the
research
project
AITECH
(http://www.aitechnet.com/ibam.html), by means of a collaborations
between the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage
53

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

IBAM-CNR, the University of Florence and the Ingegneria dei Sistemi
IDS corporation. The prototype is shown in Fig. 6. Some first results
have been recently made available [2]: it has a large equivalent band that
ranges from 50 to 1000 MHz through three couples of equivalent
antennas, connected to the system switching on and off two series of
switches. The switches allow an equivalent “cut” of the antennas, so
making them suitable also for higher bands. Moreover, the system can
prolong in a selective way the integration time of the harmonics and this
can help to reject narrow band interferences and to increase the
dynamic range. Finally, the power radiated at each frequency can be
modulated, which can help in enlarging the band equivalent radiated
pulse.
So, starting from those experimental results, it is possible to identify
some main development lines regarding this kind of technology, for
reaching the purpose of having a GPR that match the requirements for
different applications, varying its properties as resolution (frequency and
bandwidth) and dynamic range.
In the next subsection are introduced the main concepts regard
massive GPR array. A single channel GPR as the one described in
Section II produces several radar traces (amplitude towards depth) while
moved on the surface.
The final result of the data collection is a single 2D profile called Bscan, where measured amplitude of the radar signal is reported along
the depth and the length of the performed scan (Fig. 7).

(measured with a 600 MHz GPR)

As assessed in the previous Section I, the latest developments in
GPR are oriented towards the capability of obtaining real-time 3D highresolution images of surveyed areas. So, this objective is achievable
having a complete fine coverage of the surveyed area and collecting a 3D
data volume, for example performing a lot of 2D profiles, one close to the
others. Since this data collection procedure is really time consuming,
several efforts have been addressed to realize a single GPR array that
can produce a 3D data volume with just one scan. Fig.8 shows a 3D
volume collected with a single GPR sensor, performing a lot of parallel
scans.

One of the main issues regarding GPR array design is the antennas
spatial distribution; this aspect must compliance Nyquist sampling
theorem, according the following Eq. (1) [3].
x 

 min
c

4 sin( ) 4 sin( ) f

r

(1)

In Eq. (1), x is the spatial separation between two GPR profiles, c is
the speed of light in vacuum,  is the half beam of the GPR antenna (that
can be assumed to be 60°), f is the main working frequency, r is the
relative dielectric constant of the soil (maximum expected value is 15
while common value is 9).
This equation gives the closeness constraint of the GPR sensors inside
the array. So, for GPR system commonly used for Civil Engineering
application, which working frequency is within 200 MHz and 1000 MHz,
this constraint means that maximum separation between profiles must
be less than 14 cm for 200 MHz GPR system and 2.8 cm for 1000 MHz
GPR system, considering a standard soil with relative dielectric constant
equal to 9. Typically the specifications for the array design are more
restrictive, the spacing between the sensors has to be less than the limit
described above, considering that data collection should compliance the
constraint even in soils with higher relative dielectric constant (up to
15).
Typical GPR antennas are planar dipoles, with a far from negligible
width. One of the important aspects that must be taken in account in
designing a GPR array is how to respect the requested specs, a way
could be using more than one array with an offset, interleaving the
profiles of one an array with the profiles of the others, in order to reduce
overall profiles spacing.
Summarizing, in designing a GPR array, the first aspect that have to
be approached is the definition of the working frequency, studying the
application. Then, the minimal geometrical specifications are given by
Eq. (1); in the design process the antenna technology and the number of
required array have to be defined.
3D data volume collected by GPR arrays can be observed with
dedicated software tools; a significant data representation is the C-scan,
a slice of the 3D volume taken at constant depth [4].
In Fig. 9 a typical C-scan of a street is reported, taken at a depth of
0.5 m; the presence of some underground utilities is confirmed by those
vertical traces on the planar view. Data were collected with 200 MHz
single GPR radar system.

V. CONCLUSION
This article describes actual GPR’s architectures such the impulsive and
the stepped frequency ones.
Two main research axes can be identified: the increase of the
sensitivity (thus the dynamic range) of GPR systems, to improve the
usability in a wider range of conditions; the development of antenna
arrays to increase the amount and quality of data collected on-site, and
the productivity.
Regarding the first line of research some steps forwards have been
made even realizing a prototype of a reconfigurable stepped frequency
GPR system, that features some benefits in terms of adaptivity to the
environment and to the application, and in terms of increase of the
dynamic range, better rejecting the noise and the interfering signals.
Sought enhancements shall concern the selection of the optimal
working frequency and bandwidth, according to the characteristics of
the targets of interest, as well as of the best waveform to be generated
by the radar antennas.
Other important objectives in developing new GPR system are the
increase of the productivity and the achievement of high performance in
terms of detection capability and ease of data interpretation. Using a
GPR array lets acquire a huge number of radar profiles densely spaced
to reconstruct the entire 3D volume surveyed.
To assure a quick and correct data collection respecting Nyquist
criteria, large and highly dense GPR arrays have to be designed. Some
further step in this technology, which can be identified as a research
line, regards the study of innovative GPR antenna technology and GPR
sensors multiplexing.

Abstract
This paper gives an overview about state of the art and open issues in
calibration and stability procedures and protocols in use on common GPR
equipment. More in depth we will resume in a single paper recent works
(2012-2013) and propose possible enhancements or adoption in the
standardization process.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The specific topics are divided in three sections covering calibration
procedures, stability procedures and protocols. Each of these sections
summarizes the state of the art and highlights open issues as a basic
material for discussion of develops and definition of such topics
considering various types of GPR equipment.
II.

CALIBRATION PROCEDURES

Calibration is an important process in the design and use of GPR
equipment and different techniques may be applied for different
implementations (polarimetric and full-polarimetric GPR, time-domain
GPR and frequency-domain GPR). Polarimetric GPR requires accurate
calibration of channel imbalance and crosstalk for both phase and
amplitude terms. Current techniques for calibration of Polarimetric GPR
data always ignore high-order terms to simplify equations. Reference
[1], [2] explain a mathematical formulation to improve the accuracy of
calibrating polarimetric GPR data. Such procedure effectively separates
the crosstalk from the channel imbalance and radiometric calibration
and removes the crosstalk errors caused by higher-order terms.
Reference [3] also covers a section about external calibration (i.e.,
finding the GPR transfer function), errors and the relative setup.
59

Comparisons between time-domain and frequency-domain GPR are
presented for two different scenarios: above water layers and above
sandy soil layer. A third scenario depicts antenna calibration above
saline water.
III.

STABILITY PROCEDURES

Stability issues, as reported in [3], affect most time-domain (TD) and
frequency-domain (FD) GPR. Measurements are usually carried out into
free-space simulation in anechoic chambers. Some significant drift has
been observed in TD-GPR due to not-in-sync pulse generator. This drift
can affect the phase of the signal in the frequency domain in high
frequency components.
Difference in stability between TD- and FD-GPR is reported to be
because of the different type of antenna (bowtie, or biconical, for TD and
horn for FD). Horn antenna is usually more directive than bowtie
antenna. There seems to be a relation between stability and the
measure after VNA calibration using high precision OSM (open, short,
match) kit. Using a time-lapse measure lasting for 3 hours immediate
after calibration reported an acceptable instability if performing radar
measurements at least 18 minutes after calibration.

IV.

PROTOCOLS

Reference [4] describes a dated proposal for standardized test and
evaluation procedures. This work was inspired by the emergency of
having multisensory mine detection systems describing issues to be
addressed when drafting best practice documents. Test has been
conducted on hand-held devices thus keeping vehicle-based solutions
in mind.
V.

CONCLUSION

Testing, calibration and stability procedures and protocols on the GPR
equipment still need some definitions and the depiction of possible
scenarios with different GPR implementations. A good starting point will
be then the classification of device and technologies from different
manufacturers and the possible use for each device. This means like a
double-entry table for each topic having GPR equipment on rows and
scenarios on columns.

Abstract
In this paper some results achieved with an innovative reconfigurable stepped
frequency ground penetrating radar (GPR) are shown. In particular, we focus on
the case history of the church of St. John Baptist in Parabita (near Lecce,
Southern Italy). The aim is to show that reconfigurable GPR systems can provide
meaningful results, and constitute an issue worth studying in more depth.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The reconfigurability is an issue being dealt with for several years now
in the framework of wireless communication system, especially with
regard to arrays of antennas [1],[2]. In that context, the reconfigurability
is meant as the possibility to change the impedance and/or the
radiation pattern of the antenna, so that the system can change the
frequency
work
band
and/or
the
direction
of
maximum
transmission/reception of the signal.
More recently, the concept of the reconfigurability has been
transferred into the framework of the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
prospecting. In particular, the GPR reconfigurability has been
introduced as the possibility to change some parameter of the system vs
the frequency so to enlarge the available band [3]. In particular, we
might think to change the input reactance and resistance of the
antennas by means of a bank of capacitors and inductors and by means
of lambda fourth transformers [4]. The antenna impedance can be
changed also by means of suitable cut to the arms of the antennas,
performed by means of one or more series of switches placed along their
length.
In particular, this equivalent “cut” of the arms allows to control also
on the radiation pattern. In particular, unlike the case of
communication devices, in the framework of GPR prospecting it is
63

63

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

desirable to have a radiation pattern not much variable vs the
frequency, and in particular with a unique broadside radiation beam
[5]. Actually, when the arms of the antenna are cut by means of the
switches, the detached parts of the arms play the role of passive
(parasitic) elements, on which induced currents arise. However,
simulation results achieved on “pixelled” antennas have shown that the
effect of these parasitic elements are not expected to be dramatic [6],
especially if the part of the antenna cut out is in its turn cut in several
electrically small sub-parts, so that the currents induced on the passive
elements result reduced.
In 2008, the research Project AITECH (www.ibam.aitechnet.html), led
by the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage IBAM-CNR
and financed by the Puglia Region, has given the chance, among other
things, to implement a prototype of reconfigurable stepped frequency
GPR system, that has been projected by IBAM-CNR, University of
Florence and IDS S.p.A. The system has been conceived equipped with
two bow tie antennas with two series of switches along their arms, so
that (according to the qualitative scheme of Fig. 1) we have two “long
antennas” if all the switches are set “on”, two “medium antennas” if the
internal switches are set on and the external ones are set off, and two
“short antennas” if all the switches are set off. Moreover, the system
allows to prolong selectively the integration time of each radiated
harmonic signal: in this way, it is possible to improve the rejection of
narrow band interferences prolonging only slightly the comprehensive
required measurement time.

The frequencies most affected by interferences can be inferred from
the same GPR data, by examining, e.g., the variance of the in-phase and
in-quadrature components through the samples gathered at any fixed
frequency.
The system is already equipped with a code able to do this too.
Finally, it is possible to modulate the transmitted power vs the
frequency, so to equalize (partially) the shape of the equivalent received
synthetic pulse. The comprehensive band spanned by the system
ranges from 50 MHz to 1 GHz, but sub-bands can be optionally
selected. For any spanned band, all the equivalent couples of antennas
(long, medium and short) can be exploited, or two of them (namely the
long and medium antennas or the medium and short antennas). After
gathering the data, it is well advised to choose the most suitable bands
for the processing of the data gathered with any equivalent couple of
antenna looking at the amplitude spectrum of the data. The
reconfigurable system has been recently tested in several sites, both
indoor and outdoor, in comparison with a commercial system (at the
moment we have made use of a Ris-Hi Mode pulsed system equipped
with a double antennas at central frequencies 200 and 600 MHz). In
particular, here we will show the results achieved in the church of St.
John Baptist in Parabita (near Lecce, Southern Italy).

II. THE CASE HISTORY
The church of St. John Baptist, is a monument that has been enlarged
more times during the centuries. Its first nucleus is of the 15th century,
and the initial church was directed along the current transect. Then, it
was enlarged toward the orthogonal direction a first time probably
during the renaissance period (XVI century) and a second time during
the 19th century, when the church reached its current size and shape. A
restoration project is scheduled, and preliminary analyses have been
performed by IBAM-CNR in order to provide some insight possibly
helpful for the restoration works. In particular, the entire central nave
plus the right hand side nave (looking from the altar to the current
main entrance) have been prospected in order to check the presence of
buried anomalies of archaeological interest and/or possibly related to
the dynamic of the humidity within some of the lateral walls. The left
hand side lateral could not fully prospected because indeed it is a quite
narrow corridor, where it was not possible to move the trolley of the
GPR. We took this chance to test the prototype and so the church has
been prospected both with a commercial pulsed Ris Hi-Mode system
equipped with a double antennas at 200 and 600 MHz and with the
prototype of reconfigurable stepped frequency GPR system. In both
cases, two orthogonal set of B-scans were gathered and the interline
space between the scans was 40 cm. We tried to move the two systems
along the same grid, compatibly with the fact that the size of the two
systems is not exactly the same, as can be appreciated in Fig. 2.

FIG. 2  The prototype, on the left hand side, and the commercial system
on the right hand site.

In particular, the prototype is slightly larger because it works also at
lower frequencies with respect to the pulsed one.
The most meaningful slice is shown in Fig. 3. In particular, in Fig. 3
is reported a depth slice at 95 cm (time-depth conversion has been done
on the basis of the diffraction hyperbolas) and shows, among other
minor “spots” two main anomalies, indicated with 1 and 2. Due to the
size and the shape of these anomalies, we had thought of possible
crypts or hypogeal rooms.
To understand more, an endoscopic survey has been performed too,
and it resulted that there are two buried cavities on the anomalies 1
and 2.
In Fig. 3 also the endoscopic image achieved on cavity number 1 is
shown. In particular, in that point the cavity start at the depth of 85 cm
and shows a thickness of 95 cm. The images in Fig. 3 in particular, are
the best ones achieved with both instruments, and compare the image
achieved from the short antennas of the prototype with the antenna at
600 MHz of the pulsed system. As can be seen, the image achieved from
the prototype seems more defined and the two cavities appear more
marked.
During the restoration work, both cavities will be excavated. They
might be hypogeum rooms partially filled up with end product, in which
case they will be empted and reported to their original size. We have
estimated, on the basis of the data, an order of 4-5 m3 of material for
cavity number 1 and an order of 16 m3 for cavity number 2, that at any
rate might continue also outside the perimeter 2, in which case we
cannot evaluate its volume.

(right hand side), and endoscopic survey (central image).

III. CONCLUSION
In this paper a brief resume of some results achieved from a
reconfigurable stepped frequency system have been shown, compared
with the results of a commercial pulsed system. The results are
comparable and in the case at hand we dare say even better, and some
(even if very partial) ground truth has confirmed the main result of the
prospection. Beyond this one, some further case histories have been
analyzed too, only partially published up to now. In the end, the
prototype has some pros and also some cons, but it demonstrates that
the reconfigurability is a strategy technically possible for the
implementation of relatively compact multiband GPR systems.

Abstract
This is an initial word to the project 2.1 of COST TU1208. This project concerns a
diagnostics of transport infrastructure structures – pavements (line structures),
bridges and tunnels. It includes individual applications which are currently in
use in both in the implementation phase, and in the phase of research.
Furthermore, it introduces issues which need to be dealt with, so that this NDT
method could be applied in greater extent.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has had a certain tradition in the field
of diagnostics of transport infrastructure structures. Not only can it be
used for one-off structure condition diagnostics, but it can also be used
for a comparison of the development over a certain time period.
The following three chapters briefly describe the basic information on
the diagnostics of pavements, bridges and tunnels by ground
penetrating radar, while focusing on individual applications. The other
two chapters describe the needs for more intensive application of this
NDT method and open issues.
Retaining walls [1] and railway tracks [2] are ranked among other
transport infrastructure structures which are diagnosed by ground
penetrating radar but are not included here.
There are a large number of articles and research projects concerning
these issues. Only the selected and the most state-of-the-art ones are
included below. American reports from the programme SHRP 2 [3]–[5]
and the results of a European project Mara Nord [6]–[8] are some of the
complex ones.
The ground penetrating radar is usually not used as an acceptance
test, but rather for the identification of weak and damaged parts of a
structure, which occur within the course of its use. The ground
penetrating radar is often combined with other methods (Project 4.3 of
the Action). Some applications are a standard practice; others are still
being verified within research projects.

II. PAVEMENT DIAGNOSTICS
The measurements are performed on flexible (asphalt) as well as rigid
(concrete) pavements, which both have their specific properties.
Road pavements are line structures; therefore, the accuracy of
measurement location plays an important role. They are usually
performed in the longitudinal direction under high speeds, so that
traffic is not affected. In this case, the measurement is performed with
the use of one or several horn antennas, or a field of antennas,
respectively. 3D recording is performed under lower speeds. Some
applications require a local measurement, which is performed with one
or more dipole antennas. One of the first GPR applications in road
engineering was to determine the thicknesses of road pavement layers.
Nowadays, ground penetrating radar is used for pavement diagnostics
at the project level, i.e., for the evaluation of shorter road segments. It is
not used at the network level at the moment. Another extended
application is the localization of the in-built reinforcement. These
include dowels and tie bars in jointed unreinforced concrete pavement
or rebar in continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP).
The aim of other applications is the localization of hidden (under
surface) distresses, a spots where loosing of connection between layers,
layers and rebar, etc. occur. Individual applications of GPR pavement
diagnostics are shown below, in the classification to common and
research ones.
Common applications:
-

thickness of asphalt pavement layers [9]–[12];
thickness of concrete pavement layer (with or without dowels, tiebars or rebar) [10], [12];
thickness of unbound pavement layers [9], [12];
position of reinforcement in concrete pavement [13];
de-bonding and delamination of pavement layers [14];
heterogeneity of pavement:
- changing of pavement layer structure;
- identification of caverns (e.g., under concrete slabs, as a
result of floods) [15];
- identification of frost heaves [9], [16], etc.

Research applications:
-

condition of reinforcement in-build in concrete pavement (e.g.,
corrosion);
depth of surface cracks [17];
localisation of bottom-surface initiated cracks [17];
pavement pumping prediction [18];
heterogeneity of pavement (Project 2.4 and 2.5 of the action):
- moisture content;
- air voids content;
- compaction;
- segregation of aggregate.

III. BRIDGE DIAGNOSTICS
The ground penetrating radar diagnostics is usually focused on
concrete bridges, or stone-masonry arch bridges, respectively [19]. It
usually concerns the condition of the bridge deck, pavement, its
connection to the bridge deck, but also other applications. An important
role is played by the diagnostics of the location and condition of the
reinforcement in a form of construction bars and prestressed or posttensioned tendons (or their ducts). Individual applications are shown
below, in the classification to common and research ones.
The measurement is usually performed when problems occur. The
problems are found within a visual inspection–leaking, crack
occurrence, etc.
Most commonly, dipole antennas are used. The measurement of the
bridge deck is usually performed at low speeds in longitudinal as well as
in transversal direction. If necessary, a 3D measurement is used.
Regarding the diagnostics of girders and elements such as pillars, etc.,
the measurement of vertical areas is performed with a single antenna,
often manually held.
The application at girders and vertical elements is performed with a
manually led cart with a single dipole antenna.
The evaluation is usually conducted generally in the form of maps for
different depths or in the form of cuts.
Common applications [20]–[23]:
-

position of reinforcement in bridge deck (spacing);
concrete cover of reinforcement in bridge deck;
thickness of bridge deck;
position of prestressed or post-tensioned tendons or tendon ducts
[24];
de-bonding and delamination of pavement layer;
bridge deck deterioration (cracks, caverns, etc.).

Research applications:
-

diameter of reinforcement in-build in concrete [25];
condition of reinforcement in bridge deck (e.g., corrosion);
evaluation of sealing course on bridge deck [26];
moisture content;
bridge girder diagnostics [27], etc.

IV. TUNNEL DIAGNOSTICS
Regarding the ground penetrating radar diagnostics, the least
documented area is the evaluation of condition of tunnels. The reasons
is lower number of these structures and more difficult access for
measurements, which nearly always depend on regular maintenance
(tube cleaning, equipment check, etc.).
73

73

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The main focus is on the determination of the thickness and
condition of a tunnel wall, including the evaluation of reinforcement
condition. Apart from this, hollow spaces between concrete and rock are
evaluated.
The measurement is performed at the tunnel lining different slope
areas at different heights with the use of special mounts built in the
measuring vehicle, or with a manually held antenna. Horn or dipole
antennas are used. The evaluation comes in the form of maps.
Common applications [28], [29]:
-

position of reinforcement in tunnel wall;
thickness of tunnel wall;
homogeneity of tunnel wall.

Research applications:
-

condition of reinforcement in tunnel wall;
hollow spaces between concrete and rock;
moisture content, etc.

V. COMMON NEEDS
The issues which need to be dealt with in order to improve the use of
ground penetrating radar in practice are shown below. These issues
need to be explained to the common users of this NDT method as well
as to administrators of transport infrastructure structures, who order
diagnostics by this method.
-

-

-

-

optimum device setting for specific application–number of
channels, antenna frequency, measurement speed, method of
localization of the measurement spot, etc.;
determination of measurement accuracy (in depth)–acceptance of
this accuracy for basic applications, particularly for the
determination of individual road pavement layer thicknesses and
reinforcement location;
raster optimization of the measurement–3D measurement versus
line measurement (in two perpendicular directions);
minimization of the number of drill holes for calibration needs–the
use of methods CMP (Common Mid Point), WARR (Wide-Angle
Reflection and Refraction) and others;
the method how the measurement results should be fed into
databases and road administrators’ systems (e.g. layer thickness).

VI. OPEN ISSUES
The issues mentioned in the previous chapter are being dealt with at a
certain level. Apart from them, it is necessary to tackle others which
need to be dealt with in future:
74

-

-

-

automation when evaluating the measured data for specific
applications;
training of personnel for these applications in terms of
measurement and evaluation;
integration of this NDT method into European standards and
technical specifications (In Europe, there is no equivalent to
standards ASTM D4748-10 [30] and ASTM D6087-08 [31], which
deals with the application of ground penetrating radar for roads
and bridges; only in some European countries, there are technical
specifications, e.g. DMRB 7.3.2 [32] in UK and B 10 Merkblatt
[33] in Germany);
performance of comparative tests of individual devices at national
and international level (at least for pavement diagnostics, where
similar tests are carried out for other devices measuring variable
parameters);
optimization of costs for individual GPR applications in road
engineering and inclusion of prices in the issued price lists of
rates.

VII. CONCLUSION
GPS is already in use at all three types of transport infrastructure
structures (pavements, bridges and tunnels). A number of applications
are standard procedures, but even for them there is still a room for
improvement and there is still need to set stricter regulations. The
application of this method either separately or in combination with
other NDT methods is being tested. The results of this commencing
COST action should support this effort.

Abstract

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has proved its ability to act as a powerful
geophysical non-destructive tool for subsurface investigations. The remarkable
technological developments have increased, among others, the practice of GPR in
sensing and mapping utilities and voids. In particular, GPR is effectively used to
locate and map objects such as pipes, drums, tanks, cables and underground
features or to detect subsurface voids related to subsidence and erosion of
ground materials. Furthermore, deploying GPR methods prior to directional
drilling prevents damage to existing utilities, thus resulting in cost effective
installations. In that frame, this paper presents some studies showing the GPR
performances and limitations, from single-channel systems to the potential of
multi-channel 3D imaging and integrating systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Transportation agencies need accurate methods for measuring the nearsurface and subsurface conditions of their transportation facilities.
Determining pavement thickness, detecting voids beneath pavements
and measuring the moisture content in pavement layers are examples of
subsurface pavement conditions for which data are necessary. One
promising technology for addressing these issues is Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) [1].
GPR is a non-invasive and non-destructive tool that has been
successful in some transportation applications, such as profiling
asphalt pavement thickness and detecting air filled voids. Furthermore
it is used for a variety of applications, including: mapping underground
utilities, profiling ice thickness, bathymetric (depth measurements)
surveys of fresh water lakes, archaeological investigations, shallow
bedrock profiling, measuring pavement thickness, measuring pavement
base and subbase thickness, locating voids beneath pavements,

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

detecting bridge deck delimitation, mapping soil stratigraphy and
characterizing environmental contamination [1].
In France, some legal accidents in 2007 and 2008 have led to modify
the regulation of work in the neighbourhood of utility networks which
has been official since July 01, 2012, including one legislation, four
decrees and a standard (NF S 70-003- Part1 to Part3) [2].
In one hand, the responsibility of the owners is increased while
three levels define the accuracy of localisation of a utility, from class A
when the uncertainty of positioning is below 40 cm, to class C when it
is above (for this last case, complementary investigations being
required). On the other hand, the SIG mapping of utility network has
become the central subject of the territorial collectivities, which have to
invest in geomatic science.
The first trials followed by two pilot cities have shown mitigated
results. Indeed, three businesses are gathered: the knowledge of the
utilities, the detection and geo-localisation techniques, but the
professional community is not yet well prepared to such accuracy
requirements. Indeed, training courses are under construction,
supervised by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and
Energy, due to the fact that two certifications in 2017, for detection and
geo-localisation, will be necessary for services companies.
In such frame, GPR imaging is one of the promising non-destructive
methods that have offered new opportunities for mapping the
subsurface structures of shallow earth in highly urbanized regions [3,
4]. The present paper refers to the procedures used for an effective GPR
sensing and mapping of underground utilities and voids with a focus to
urban areas.
II.

MAPPING OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES

The often-repeated infrastructural improvements in basic infrastructure
facilities are road widening and relocation of utilities. If there are no
proper care and systematic work approach observed, the road works
may disrupt and cause damage to underground utilities. Hence,
mapping of these underground utilities is necessary to avoid great loss
and accidents [5].
Underground utility mapping is a process of identifying the position
and labelling public utility mains which are located underground. These
mains may include lines for telecommunication, electricity distribution,
natural gas, water mains and wastewater pipes (Fig.1). In some
location, major oil and pipe lines, national defence communication
lines, mass transit, rail and road tunnels also compete for space
underground [6].

FIG. 1 Underground utilities [6].

Underground utility mapping refers to the detection, positioning and
identification of buried pipes and cables beneath the ground,
corresponding to three businesses. It deals with features mainly
invisible to the naked eyes. While the determination of position can be
obtained with conventional or modern survey equipment, the detection
and identification of underground utilities require special tools and
techniques [7].
GPR is commonly used to locate and map objects such as pipes,
drums, tanks, cables and underground features or utilities. In
application of utilities detection, radar data are used to detect the
existence of underground utilities which mainly have different
conductivity and dielectric properties from its surrounding.
Several studies have been carried out concerning the mapping of
underground utilities from last 90's to now-a-days. In 2001 the GPR
technique was used for the detection of a main water supply pipe in
Stockholm, Sweden [8]. The presence of the pipe was well known,
although the exact location was unknown. The survey was performed
over a road in which several pipes and cables were buried. In order to
locate the pipe a large number of short profiles (16 parallel profiles)
were conducted perpendicular to the presumed strike of the pipe, using
a 500 MHz shielded antenna. The data were loaded into a 3D
visualization and processing software for analysis.
Another study was carried out in main campus of Universiti Sains
Malaysia, Penang, specifically located at School of Social Sciences [5].
The aim of the study was to locate and map underground utilities or
pipes that existed at the study area that could be used as a preliminary
study for utilities mapping. Eight parallel ground penetrating radar
survey lines were executed with total length of 8m and line spacing of
2m. In this case, a shielded antenna with frequency 250 MHz was used
to detect and map utilities of the study area with suitable parameter
setting. Anomalies were detected at depth < 2.5m at several survey lines
that may be due to underground pipe, manhole trench, and
underground cable that crosses the study area. Orientations of these
utilities were successfully detected and well mapped.
In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a GPR survey was performed using a
450 MHz antenna on a major road. The contractor needed to know
where he could safely dig without hitting a utility while installing fiber
81

81

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

optic communication cables. The survey was carried out in a few
minutes, and locations of the utilities were marked on the pavement as
the survey was being conducted. The fiber optic cable contractor quickly
and safely trenched between sites of buried utilities [7].
Utility surveying was also performed at three sites in Hong Kong [9].
In this study three ground coupled centre frequency antennas - 100,
270 and 400 MHz were used. However, the use of 100 MHz antenna
was abandoned because of lack of precise horizontal distance
measurement without the usage of survey wheel. To ensure transect
lines easily and to maintain a complete coverage of the targets a grid
was used for the survey. It was achieved that the 400 MHz antenna was
good at distinguishing underlying objects less than 2m, whereas 270
MHz one was 2m below.
Another utility-mapping was performed in two areas located in
downtown São Paulo City, Brazil [10]. The main objective of this work
was to locate subsoil utilities, such as, piping, galleries, electric cables
etc., as well as concrete columns supporting the Roosevelt Road tunnel–
viaduct complex in advances of the construction of the Line 4 subway
(yellow) tunnel in São Paulo.
GPR measurements were performed using 200 MHz shielded
antennas. Lines were surveyed along both the north-south and eastwest directions in a polygonal area in order to achieve a pseudo 3D grid
by 2D data interpolation. Interpretations of GPR results, combined with
lithological information available from boreholes and trenches opened in
the study areas provided important information for accurate location of
shallow utilities in the subsurface. The study showed that the GPR
method was a very important and useful step to precede excavation of
São Paulo subway tunnels, providing the precise location of utilities in
subsoil, as well as an estimate of their depths of occurrence. As a final
point, based on these results, geotechnical work was safely carried out,
and risks of dangerous accidents were avoided [10].
Through these few examples the benefit of performing several
parallel profiles was clearly demonstrated. An object located in one
profile only could easily be interpreted as a pipe, if interpretation were
done in 2D only. By combining several profiles and load them into a 3D
software, it’s easy to check whether the object is extending linearly or
not. Thus this kind of interpretation improves the security of the
investigation, at the cost of time. It is especially valuable when the site
conditions are more difficult e.g. when many pipes and boulders are
present. Moreover these researches showed that the ability of GPR to
detect not only metallic objects, but also non-metallic objects (e.g.
plastic, concrete ceramics or fiber optic cable), makes it a powerful tool
to complement traditional methods in utility locating. This is of
considerable importance, since an increasing fraction of buried pipes
are non-metallic.

In the framework of a research program performed by the New York
State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) utility-mapping at two
sites was successful in that GPR was able to (a) identify buried utility
infrastructure both at previously known and unknown locations, (b)
successfully cover the entire pavement intersection at both sites in
relatively short period of time, and (c) achieve superior 3D image quality
because of the multi-channel (array system) GPR/GPS capability that is
not available in typical single-channel and even two-channel GPR
systems [11].
The system used covers 5.12 feet with each instrument pass
obtaining 14 channels of GPR data within each swath. Multiple parallel
and transverse instrument passes were done at each site in order to
obtain sufficient coverage to produce the 3D images. Post processing
and interpretation were performed to generate the 3D images, maps and
CAD drawings that were delivered for the project. These 3D images
produced from specialized proprietary multiple antenna hardware and
processing software, are much more illustrative and accurate than the
vertical slice provided by a single antenna. For instance, the images can
be rotated to achieve the optimal view of a critical utility crossing, and
can be superimposed over pavement edges, curbs and other surface
features for ease of identification. The system produces utility locations
in X, Y and Z coordinates to within a few centimeters, usually within
one or two centimeters. The results of this study illustrated the ability of
multi-channel GPR technology to detect and map buried utilities,
indicating the utility depths, orientations, and proximities to other
surrounding infrastructure.
In addition, Road and Bridge Research Institute (Internal Project
PW.S 531) have investigated the implementation of 3D Radar into
practical use in road measurements in order to assess its real abilities
in road diagnostics [12]. This radar model is a step-frequency system
working in range 300MHz to 3GHz what correspond in practice to
resolution of 700MHz impulse antenna. The antenna chamber contains
15 transmitter-receiver pairs allowing simultaneous data acquisition
along 15 parallel profiles on road lane of width 2.4 m. The system has
odometer and GPS antenna that allow excellent synchronisation of data
sets collected in different measurement passages and next construction
of horizontal slices of some wider area. Using real-time GPS equipment,
one decimetre precision of data positioning and synchronisation is
available. Thus the system has excellent possibilities in identification
and localisation of utilities, combining proper software that developed
by the producer, for such large data sets.
The identification of linear objects is based on wide review of
horizontal slices, where thick linear objects have fine manifestations,
with the possibility to visualise sets of horizontal slices and sets of
vertical cross-sections. The effective penetration depth in road
environments can be estimated to about 1 up to 1.5 m where some
ground horizons were observed in rare cases. Thus the system has
83

83

TUD COST Action TU1208

some possibilities of sub-base thickness estimation, and can give also
fine evidence of media having complicate, strongly irregular, chaotic
structure. The equipment is very noise resistive giving fine results in
difficult electromagnetic environment where typical impulse antennae
fall.
This system has also some disadvantages, from intense
multiplications which occur in the case of strongly reflective horizons,
inducing reverberations inside the antenna chamber and then
difficulties in echogram interpretation. Moreover, the echograms have
low resolution and clarity in comparison to corresponding impulse
antennae. Nevertheless, the evolution of such array systems tends to
propose accurate approach due to high density of measurement, with
precise positioning, enabling similar resolution at lower frequencies
than single antenna systems.
Among these experimental approaches estimating the performances
of GPR systems, signal processing and imaging have been largely
studied in numerous research laboratories. In the last few years, the
ELEDIA Research Center (DISI - University of Trento, Italy) developed
several techniques for real-time detection and classification of buried
objects based on learning-by-examples (LBE), such as Support Vector
Machines (SVM) [13][14]. A lot of work has been also addressed towards
the development of inversion schemes based on the integration of both
global and local search algorithms with multi-focusing strategies. As a
significant example, the integration of the Inexact Newton Method (INM)
with a computationally efficient multi-focusing scheme has been
successfully validated in [15] when dealing with GPR measurements. A
significant interest has been also addressed towards the application of
innovative inversion procedures based on Bayesian Compressive
Sensing (BCS) [16] and Interval Analysis [17] to the problem of
subsurface prospecting. The localization of sparse metallic targets has
been recently addressed in [18] by means of a new technique that
models the targets through the local shape function (LSF) approach and
solves the inversion problem in a BCS sense.
III. DETECTION OF VOIDS
The development of voids beneath roadways can lead to major pavement
failures. Voids typically develop because of subsidence and erosion of
the base and subgrade materials. Void-related roadway problems have
often developed near water supply pipes or drainpipes. Leaks, pipe
breaks or dislocated joints allow fines to be carried away, resulting in
local base or foundation erosion and the formation of weak areas, which
eventually become voids. Voids continue to increase in size until the
load carrying capacity of the roadway is compromised [19]. Voids can be
either air or water filled.
Void detection beneath roadways using GPR is performed in many
countries [19, 20]. For example the Texas Department of Transportation
84

84

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

(TxDOT) and Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) have successfully used
the GPR technology to locate voids under roadway pavements [21]. The
case-study presented here concerns the maintenance of a continuously
reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) section, which presented
longitudinal cracks just after a patch repair. This has prompted district
personnel to request an investigation to assess the safety of the
structure and to determine if there were significant voids under the
CRCP.
A 400 MHz ground-coupled antenna was used to survey and map
the subsurface condition. GPR data was collected in the longitudinal
direction parallel to the faulted joint and at selected transverse
locations. A significant anomaly adjacent to the drainpipe was found
which started directly under the CRCP. Based on the GPR image, the
estimated size of the suspected void was significant (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2 Example of a drop-off of a continuously reinforced concrete pavement
due to voids [19].

The GPR data indicated an anomaly over the transverse storm drain.
This drain was separated and it was verified that this separation caused
water to erode the area around the drain. Fortunately, the disjointed
storm pipe was identified before severe roadway failure occurred.
In terms of concrete investigation, GPR has an excellent reputation
for being able to image voids beneath concrete sections [22]. This kind
of application was performed in United Kingdom where a test slab was
used. The test slab forms part of the NSGG (Near-Surface Geophysics
Group of the Geological Society) shallow geophysics test facility at the
University of Leicester. The focus of this research was the practical
detection of sub-metre scale voids located under steel reinforced
concrete sections in realistic survey conditions (a capped, relict mine
shaft or vent. Fig. 3 shows the general layout of the reinforced concrete
test slab and images of data collection with the GPR.

85

TUD COST Action TU1208

FIG. 3 Target void layout and data collection across the reinforced concrete
test slab [13].

A GPR unit with 450 MHz and 900 MHz shielded antenna was used
for all GPR surveys, in orthogonal grid, with each trace collected
manually at defined intervals and processed using conventional
methodologies. The results of these surveys have shown that the
selection of antenna frequency is important and that care must be
taken with the mode and configuration of the survey geometries.
In 2011, Mara Nord, an international cooperative project financed by
Interreg IV A Nord, has been initiated among Finland, Sweden and
Norway. In this project, one goal was to produce common guidelines for
the use of GPR in asphalt air voids content measurement that could be
used as a reference in procurement processes in all three countries [23].
In this framework, GPR technology was used to measure the dielectric
value of the asphalt pavement, which was then used to calculate the air
void content of the pavement. The method is suitable for measurement
of air void content of new bituminous pavements only, regardless of the
quality of the base course. It is suggested to be followed when doing
survey design, data collection, analysis and reporting with a 2D GPR
system prior to an asphalt air voids content measurement.
In pavement and top part of the pavement structure quality control
surveys it is recommended that air coupled antennas be used especially
when the interest is bituminous pavement and unbound base thickness
and their quality. According to these guidelines, in normal cases, it is
recommended that a 1GHz antenna be used in asphalt air voids content
surveys, but if the amount of new asphalt is 60 kg/m2 or less then it is
recommended that a 2GHz antenna be used.
Concerning the number and location of survey lines Finland has
required data collection only from the outer wheelpath and Swedish
guidelines require the survey to be done from the outer wheelpath and
between wheelpaths. Swedish guidelines can eliminate the effect of
traffic compaction from the results. That is why these guidelines
recommend that, if only one survey line is measured, it should be
measured between the wheelpaths. However recent test results have
shown that in addition to the two lines per lane it is also recommended
that one line be measured along the pavement joint in lane centre [23].
When using air coupled antennas, after every survey session and
before the GPR unit is switched off, a metal pulse reflection should be
86

86

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

recorded. It is recommended that a metal reflection is also taken before
the start of the measurement. Moreover, air voids content calculations
using GPR technique requires calibration drill cores and at least 2 drill
cores have to be taken and analyzed. The place of the drill cores should
be selected first by measuring the whole road section and then by
selecting places for the calibration cores from homogenous sections
where dielectric value of the asphalt surface is close to the approximate
average dielectric value of the new asphalt.
Several processing techniques, such as GA-based integrated
strategy, have been proposed and assessed in [24] with unknown
defects both in location and in size situated inside dielectric host
mediums. Moreover, in [25] a new approach based on the integration
between a multi-scaling procedure and the level-set-based optimization
has been proposed, aimed at the reconstruction of the shape of multiple
and disconnected homogeneous scatters. Such an approach can be
clearly applied to the problem of void detection, as well as to the
retrieval of metallic objects, by exploiting measurements collected from
GPR systems.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

GPR has been used successfully with other technologies to identify and
locate utilities—often previously unknown—prior to excavation, coring,
or boring activities. Yet its full potential for augmenting subsurface
utility-mapping has not been adequately researched, demonstrated, or
determined. Part of this limitation has been due to the overwhelming
use of single-channel GPR systems, as well as highly variable training
and expertise in its use on an ad-hoc basis.
Over the past several years, significant technological progress has
been made both in the hardware and software imaging systems
dedicated to simplifying utility-detection, particularly multi-channel 3D
imaging and mapping systems integrating GPR with complementary
technologies and survey-grade GPS. These systems are capable of
collecting larger areas of data more efficiently and more accurately
demonstrating the results. It is expected that these collective
technological changes will benefit the inspection procedures for effective
GPR sensing and mapping of underground utilities and voids.

Abstract
The paper gives a review of methods related to assessment of construction
materials properties by the use of GPR technique, focusing on recent research
activity of Project 2.4 members in COST Action TU1208. The electromagnetic
properties of the investigated media are interesting because they reflect another
physical features of the materials (first of all their composition), giving possibility
of non-invasive inspection of their condition. Moreover, the assessment of
electromagnetic properties (e.g., wave velocity) is an inherent part of any GPR
structural study necessary for correct depth recognition or amplitude
interpretation. As a result of the review major directions of researches and some
general problems of this methodological area were described.

I.

INTRODUCTION

GPR measurements are deeply involved in considerations related to
material properties of the media being scanned. In GPR measurements
electromagnetic properties of the media are manifested extensively and
these properties plays crucial role in further interpretations of
measurements. Actually, any structural interpretation of the GPR
results refers to wave velocity of the medium [1],[2]. On the other hand,
the electromagnetic properties are closely related to other physical
features of the investigated materials and mainly to their composition
and small-scale structure (heterogeneous distribution of the
components). Thus, the GPR measurements and results of their
interpretation have usually interesting consequences in assessment of
some material properties of the scanned medium. The relation between
electromagnetic properties and compositional-structural properties of
the medium usually needs investigations aimed to the specific category
of materials representative for the given area of technology (e.g.,
concrete structures). This kind of experience formulates interpretation
keys which allow successful interpreting the GPR results.
The problem of GPR inspection of material properties and structures
has several levels and it links different types of research activity:
91

91

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

 methodologies of structural interpretations of GPR measurements
directed on assessment of electromagnetic material properties
(reflection amplitude determination, velocity analysis, travel time
modelling, migration, hyperbola fitting, etc.);
 methodologies for direct investigation of the electromagnetic
properties of the media;
 numerical simulations supporting the structural interpretations
or laboratory measuring systems;
 investigations of the electromagnetic properties of specific
categories of materials and their relation with other physical
features.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF THE REAL MATERIALS
Most of phenomena observed in GPR practice can be described by the
use of complex relative electric permittivity εr* = εr’ + i∙εr’’, characterising
interaction of the homogeneous medium with electromagnetic field. The
presence of the imaginary part of permittivity εr’’(ω) is responsible for
wave absorption and it is closely related to frequency dependence of the
real part εr’(ω), what describe Kramers-Kronig relations [3]. The
electrical conductivity of the medium (e.g., salt water, porous rocks
filled with electrolytes) is a phenomenon belonging to the category
described by the imaginary part of permittivity, but absorption is not
necessary associated with explicit conductivity (e.g., dry concrete, clay
minerals) [3],[4]. The derivative electromagnetic properties used for
material characterization - like wave velocity, reflection coefficients and
plenty of quantities proper to numerous measuring systems - are
determined by εr* (and permeability μr*)1.
A special category of electromagnetic phenomena (reflection,
refraction, diffraction etc.) is related to interaction of the GPR signal
with inhomogeneous media and in some context these phenomena are
called scattering. These effects are particularly interesting when the
characteristic dimensions of permittivity anomalies are comparable to
local wavelength of GPR signal to cause significant response
(scattering), but they are not enough large for generation large scale
manifestations on echogram which could be interpreted as a large-scale
medium structure. Such situation is typical for real media and it has
important practical consequences which can be illustrated by the
following examples.
The continuous depth stratification is the first crucial example of the
heterogeneity (Fig. 1). In the presented case the permittivity in concrete
slab (sampled by drilling core) increases strongly inward, near the top
surface. As a result the slab has significantly different permittivity
values at the top and at the bottom.
1
In the case of materials containing significant amount of ferromagnetic minerals the magnetic
permeability μr* can play important role [4] in formation of GPR response, but it is very rare exception
among construction materials. Thus usually the relative permeability is assumed to be equal to one.

92

Moreover, in this case the reflection amplitude (peak-to-peak
amplitude) measured at the top of the plate (where gradient occurs) is
frequency-dependent (Fig. 2) despite the medium has not frequencydependent permittivity. In the GPR image the stratification is
manifested only as some deformation of the surface reflection.

FIG. 1  Characteristic features of the permittivity distribution
in sandy concrete, after [31].

FIG. 2  Numerical 1-D simulation of the GPR response (air-coupled
configuration) of concrete slab having velocity stratification at the top. The
shape and amplitude of the surface reflection (about zero time) visibly depends
on the impulse frequency, despite the medium is non-dispersive was here.

93

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The second important type of heterogeneity is related to media of
granular structure like in stone-asphalt mixtures (Fig. 3). In the
presented example smoothed permittivity observed in centimetre space
scales, ranges from 6 to 8.
The distribution well illustrates the ‘problem of scaling’ in definition
and determination physical properties (and their spatial distribution) of
real media.
Any determination is dependent on resolution (smoothing scale) and
results have large dispersion giving a measure of local inhomogeneity.
Thus, the measurements dedicated to interdependence of parameters
are very difficult.

FIG. 3  Map of the permittivity distribution on the lateral surface of the
drilling core (from the right), panoramic photo of the lateral surface and the
depth distribution of the level average permittivity and photo of the core [32].

Moreover, the electromagnetic properties are well determined
numbers (material characteristics) for the homogeneous medium only.
But for inhomogeneous media the primary meaning of these notions
falls down and these terms are used in practice as some provisional
characterisation of the medium in the frame of the given method. The
granular media have also a special type of signal attenuation due to
lateral scattering (non-dissipative attenuation). The absorption related
to imaginary part of permittivity should be distinguished from wave
attenuation related to scattering, but is usually difficult to make this
distinction in GPR measurement practice.

III. MAJOR DIRECTIONS OF THE RESEARCHES
Among research efforts, several directions related to different material
types can be distinguished. Despite different technical details, they have
shared methodological background.
Soils and subgrades materials [5]–[14] have relatively long tradition of
GPR investigations [5]. The field investigations are focused on
94

94

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

determination of water content [6], [7], [11], [14] and composition
(especially content of clay minerals [9], [10] responsible for important
bearing properties of subbase [12], [13]). Among laboratory methods one
can find determinations of frequency-dependent complex permittivity of
soils [8] and specific methods for aggregate permittivity determination
based on ‘frequency peak shift’ [9], [10].
The investigations of cement concrete [15]–[27] are focused on
moisture content and composition manifested mostly in permittivity
value, and on electrolytes (e.g. chlorides) content increasing the
absorption. Among numerous approaches one can find analyses of the
direct wave amplitude [15], [21], analyses of amplitude, relative
attenuation and spectrum of the slab bottom reflection [16], [19], [27]
and numerical modelling of the signal interaction with slab simulating
the real geometry of the measuring system [17], [22]. These efforts allow
for non-invasive determination of the slab permittivity and absorption in
adequate [22] and efficient way [20] and some of them can be used in
the field investigations [18]. Laboratory investigations of concrete
properties focus on determination of complex permittivity as a function
of frequency [23], [24], dependence of the permittivity on composition
[25], [26] and considerations related to perspectives of complex
permittivity determination on the base of refracted wave analysis [23].
The investigations of concrete properties have large practical industrial
use (assessment of the concrete type, degree of degradation), as it is
widely used construction material [personal communication from
Geofisica Consultores (Spanish Geophysical Consulting)].
Investigations of asphalt mixtures [28]–[34] are focused on
composition, estimations of void content [30], [34] and moisture
content. Permittivity values are dominated by properties of the stone
fraction of the mixture but compaction degree has also some
significance. The laboratory determination of permittivity and its
relation with composition is very difficult due to coarse grain structure
of this material. Thus, the investigations of fundamental properties are
rare [28], [29], [32], [33] and some predictive relations [4] are frequently
used [30] instead of reliable estimations.
The strongly heterogeneous structure of asphalt mixture [32] and its
interaction with high frequency GPR signal is a large area for future
investigations.
For alternative determinations of permittivity and absorption some
auxiliary non-GPR techniques are being used (capacimetry, resistivity
measurements and imaging, TDR etc.).
It is worth to note that these alternative methods and comparative
studies of different GPR approaches plays crucial role in development of
the material testing techniques. The measuring systems have usually
not elementary geometry influencing the results, and this influence
cannot be well described by simple models. Comparative studies using
reference materials and the same samples give possibility of the
methods verification and allow estimating the influence of different
types of material heterogeneity on results. Comparative studies help
also to identify problems which are not visible in the frame of one
approach.

IV. CONCLUSION
The review of the research efforts related to construction materials GPR
testing shows large importance of comparative studies of the measuring
methods. These comparisons are necessary for ability assessment and
verification of these methods. This diagnostic discipline is an interesting
and fruitful area for numerical modelling commenting on measuring
procedures (with regarding the real geometry of the measuring systems).
Investigations of heterogeneous materials structure and their GPR
response constitute a large and relatively new research area.

Abstract
Volumetric water content assessment in structures, substructures, soils, and
subsurface in general is a crucial issue in a wide range of applications. The
main disadvantages of subsurface moisture sensing techniques are usually
related both to the lack of cost-effectiveness of the measurements, and to
unsuitable support scales with respect to the extension of the surfaces to be
covered and to the dimensions of the target to detect. In this regard, groundpenetrating radar (GPR) is an increasingly used non-destructive tool specifically
suited for characterization and imaging. Several GPR techniques have been
developed for different applications. In the case of moisture evaluation in
concrete, the detection is important for the diagnosis of concrete structures at
early stages of deterioration: water penetrating into the concrete pore networks
contributes to the transfer of degrading and corrosive agents such as chloride.
Concerning the particular case of identifying soil surface water content, two GPR
approaches are commonly used, namely the ground-wave method and the
reflection method; further, a different approach to shallow soil water content
estimation is based on the analyses of the surface reflections of an off-ground
system. This can be performed by using traditional off-ground methods or by
using inverse modeling of an off-ground monostatic GPR system.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Volumetric water content (VWC) dynamics in structures, substructures,
soils, and subsurface in general is a key component in many fields of
application such as agriculture, construction, geotechnical stability
analyses, hydrological, and other environmental studies. Usually, water
content measurements techniques at the field scale are invasive as well
as time-consuming methods, e.g., gravimetric sampling or time-domain
reflectometry (TDR) [1].
In that respect, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is an increasingly
used near-surface remote sensing tool specifically suited for
characterization and imaging. Many efforts have been devoted to the
use of GPR since the 1960s, particularly in archeology and civil
99

99

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

engineering for detecting buried objects or investigating subsurface
structures [2]–[4]. Several GPR techniques addressed to moisture
sensing have been developed for different applications [5], [6] and
materials: concrete structures [7], natural soils [8] as well as hot-mix
asphalt layers [9] require specific approaches and model assumptions to
reliably estimate the subsurface volumetric water content. In this paper,
an overview of the most diffused techniques in VWC sensing is
presented, also providing some insights for further developments of the
researches.

II.

VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT IN CONCRETE STRUCTURES

The detection of moisture is important for the diagnosis of concrete
structures at early stages of deterioration as it determines most of the
physicochemical pathologies, such as steel reinforcement corrosion,
alkali-aggregate reaction, and freezing-and-thawing cycles. In that
respect, Sbartaï et al. [10] observed that the risk of damage is strictly
related to the degree of saturation or the moisture content in concrete.
In this context, the use of traditional methods (e.g., electrical resistivity
measurement or half-cell potential test) for assessing the condition of
structures, is time-costly and requires lane closures for the sounding of
bridge decks, with regard to the particular case of road inspections.
On the contrary, GPR is a powerful technique to characterize
concrete moisture, as it can effectively investigate large surfaces in a
relatively short time period. Many experimental studies have been
carried out in the past for assessing the effect of concrete moisture
variation [11]–[13] under controlled water content conditions. Further
researches by Klysz and Balayssac [14] showed that the direct wave
velocity and its variation of amplitude are linearly linked to the
volumetric water content of the concrete, independently of its porosity.
Both attenuation and velocity are sensitive to moisture and they can be
used for a twofold purpose: VWC and salt content estimation. In this
regard, many efforts have been also devoted to the determination of
chloride contents in concrete, directly exposing structures
reinforcement to corrosion [15]. Sbartaï et al. [16] tested the efficiency of
the neural approach for predicting water and chloride contents of
concrete by inversion of radar measurements. The results show that
artificial neural networks may be implemented to model the
experimental relationship between water and chloride contents of
concrete and radar signal features, e.g., amplitudes of direct and
reflected waves and propagation delays. Good prediction accuracy and a
high capacity of generalization were obtained both for water (absolute
error ≈ 2%) and chloride contents (absolute error < 0.5 kg/m3).
More recently, Ihamouten et al. [17] studied the validity of the various
intermethod coupling by characterizing four concrete mixtures at
different water contents. Such approach is based on a coupling between
the results of the wave–field transforms (transformations from time–
displacement plans to temporal-frequency–spatial-frequency plans) and
100

100

those of the Q-estimation methods. Promising results were obtained: the
characterization of the hydric status of various concrete mixtures was
possible by taking into account both the real and imaginary parts of
permittivity over a large GPR bandwidth.

III.

VOLUMETRIC WATER CONTENT IN UNSATURATED SOILS

Over the past decades, ground-penetrating radar has been a widespread
instrument in the areas of unsaturated zone hydrology and water
resources. Amongst the various applications, it has been used to
identify soil stratigraphy [2], to assess subsurface hydraulic parameter
[18], to locate water tables [19], and to measure soil water content [20]–
[22]. Many petrophysical relationships exist to evaluate subsurface
moisture [23], [24]. Further, it is well-known that the amount of water
in soil pore spaces influences the complex permittivity of soils as the
solid matrix permittivity is usually low over a wide range of frequencies
[25]. Therefore, soil moisture content can be effectively evaluated by
using high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) techniques.
Nowadays a gap between small-(< 0.01 m2) and large-(> 100 m2) scale
measurements is still encountered. In fact, small-scale (e.g., capacitive
sensors and TDR) and large-scale measurements (e.g., airborne and
space-borne passive microwave radiometry and active radar systems
[26]) are commonly used to characterize shallow subsurface soil water
content. On the other hand, a few amount of instruments is suited for
intermediate-scale (0.01-100 m2) characterization of shallow subsurface
soil properties.
Amongst the latter, GPR has proved to be the most promising
technique for accurately soil moisture sensing [27]–[33]. In this regard,
two GPR approaches are commonly used, namely the ground-wave
method and the reflection method. Concerning the first one, surface
VWC can be derived from the ground-wave propagation velocity [34].
The ground wave is the signal that travels directly from the source to
the receiving antenna through the soil surface. It can be recognized in
data collected using a multi-offset GPR acquisition configuration and its
velocity can be determined from the slope of the linear relationship
between the antenna separation and the ground-wave travel times. The
main drawbacks of multi-offset GPR measurements include: 1) the
method is time-consuming; and 2) a large horizontal distance of
averaging for soil permittivity. The second approach is the surface
reflection
coefficient
method,
which
uses
off-ground
radar
configurations [35], [36]. The soil surface dielectric permittivity is
derived from the Fresnel reflection coefficient, which is determined from
the ratio between the amplitude of the reflection at the soil surface and
the one obtained for a calibrating perfect electric conductor (PEC).
However, this method still remains mostly unused nowadays for realtime mapping applications, mainly due to the requirement for such
calibration [36]. In that respect, Lambot et al. [37] used an inverse
modeling of an off-ground monostatic GPR system with the possibility of
101

101

a full wave inversion of the radar signal, which takes into account the
antenna effects and does not require an antenna height-specific
calibration above a perfect electric conductor (e.g., a metal plate).
Conversely, this approach includes the relatively time-consuming wave
field inversion and uncertainties in antenna calibration that may cause
possible errors.
Concerning further insights, one of the major open issues is in
determining hydraulic soil properties in a changing water content
profile from time-lapse monitoring measurements [38].

IV.

CONCLUSION

analyzed for different materials according to various fields of application
mostly focusing in the civil engineering area.

showing different requirements on the basis of the surveyed material
according to the medium properties. Some recent advances together

Abstract
Methods developed to solve forward electromagnetic scattering by buried objects
are useful tools for interpreting data from Ground Penetrating Radar responses.
Time-domain methods, as Finite-Difference Time Domain or space-time integral
equations, are well established tools in the modeling impulse Ground
Penetrating Radar systems. Integral equation methods, when solved with
Method of Moments discretization, lead to dense linear system. Therefore, the
implementation of novel approaches approximating the integral equation via
series expansions with lower computational complexity is called for. Analytical
techniques have the advantage to be accurate and fast, as the geometry of the
scattering problem is taken into account by an expansion of the fields in terms of
suitable basis functions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The development of methods for the solution of the forward scattering
by buried objects has a wide interest in the field of Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) [1]. In this context, the modeling of forward scattering is
useful in the interpretation of data collected in the GPR surveys, in the
testing of new data processing techniques, and in general to improve
the understanding on the complex interaction between the
electromagnetic field radiated by the radar antenna and the buried
targets.
The physical and geometrical parameters implemented in the forward
solvers must be capable to represent the scattering scenario in a
manner which is as realistic as possible.
Some of the main issues are the accurate modeling of target
geometry, a suitable representation of the source field radiated by the
radar antenna, and the simulation of losses both in the embedding
media. Two-dimensional problems may be considered in many cases,
when the buried object have transverse cross-section which is small
compared to the longitudinal size.

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

The use of time-domain techniques, especially Finite-Difference TimeDomain (FDTD) method [2]–[4], is well-established to investigate and
numerically simulate GPR responses. In many scattering problems, an
approach of wire modeling of the target may be used, in either time-[5],
[6] or frequency-domain [7]. Another well-established method is based
on integral equations; a novel approach of solution, alternative to
Method of Moments (MoM) discretization, is proposed in [8], [9]. The
development of analytical techniques extends the classical problem of
scattering by a cylinder in free space, in the presence of one or more
planar or rough discontinuities. Such techniques have to cope with the
difficult task of handling different geometries, which can be fulfilled by
means of plane-wave spectrum expansion of the involved functions
relevant to the scattered fields [10]–[12].
In these paper, a review on the main established techniques and
recent advancements, carried out by the participants of the Cost Action
TU1208, for the modeling of forward scattering by buried objects is
presented. Section II is dedicated to time-domain methods. A novel
integral equation method is described in Section III. In Section IV,
analytical approaches for two- and three-dimensional scattering
problems are reported.

II. TIME-DOMAIN APPROACHES
Time-domain techniques are well suited in the frame of GPR
applications, dealing with the scattering by a pulsed signal.
Among the possible approaches, FDTD method is a well-established
one. A free of charge FDTD software tool developed to simulate GPR
responses is GprMax, developed by Giannopoulos [2]. Both twodimensional (GprMax2D) and three-dimensional (GprMax3D) models
can be analyzed with this FDTD software. GprMax2D is mainly used for
GPR "signature" simulations, whereas GprMax3D is used for a more
realistic modeling of GPR problems, especially when comparisons with
measured GPR data must be performed.
A fundamental issue in the modeling of GPR problems is the
simulation of open boundaries, whereas FDTD takes into account of a
finite simulation space, where all the source and output points, as well
as the significant targets, are included. In [2], Absorbing Boundary
Conditions (ABCs), applied at a sufficient distance from the source and
the targets, and capable to simulate an unbounded geometry, are used
to limit the computational space.
The main limitations in the FDTD method are in the staircase
approximation of curved interfaces, and in the conditionally stable
nature of the FDTD. The condition of stability, known as CFL, states
that the three spatial variables x, y, and z, and the temporal
discretization step t cannot be assigned independently. Therefore,
when a small spatial step is used for an adequate modeling of the
objects in the computation domain, the allowable discretization timestep used in the FDTD time-advancement is small as well. Moreover,
110

110

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

the choice of small spatial steps in the simulation of structures of fine
geometry in a large computation domain results in high computer
memory requirements and long execution times. A solution to this
problem has been proposed by Diamanti and Giannopoulos in [3],
where subgrids with small spatial steps are introduced in a coarser
FDTD grid.
The implementation of the subgrids is particularly useful to model
parts of the computation domain with finer detail, or when regions with
high dielectric constants supporting waves propagating at very short
wavelengths are included in the computational mesh. An example of
subgriding scheme has been also presented in [4], applied to simulate
GPR responses from delaminations in brick masonry arches.
In many subsurface sensing applications, especially communication,
power cables and geophysical investigations, thin wires can be used for
the modeling of buried targets. In the literature, the electromagnetic
field coupling to an arbitrary configuration of buried thin wires is solved
with two main approaches: transmission line (TL) and wire antenna
theory. TL approach [7], developed in the frequency domain, is based on
telegrapher’s equation. It may lead to a satisfactory approximation for
long straight conductors with electrically small cross sections but it is
not valid for finite length wires, wires of arbitrary shape and high
frequency excitations.
For a more rigorous solution, applicable to finite-length buried wires
of arbitrary shape, antenna wire methods can be used [5]–[6]. Solution
is carried out in the time-domain, evaluating the transient current
excited on a thin wire buried in a lossy half-space, in case of an
electromagnetic pulse excitation. This formulation deals with space-time
integral or integro-differential equation, of Hallen or Pocklington type,
solved via the Galerkin–Bubnov scheme of the indirect boundary
element.

III. FULL-WAVE INTEGRAL EQUATION APPROACHES
Integral equation approaches are widely used to model scattering
phenomena. The equation is typically solved in a discretized way,
making use of MoM. Anyway, MoM solution generally leads to a dense
linear system, that turns out to be more and more costly the more
complex is the scenario to be modeled.
The main drawbacks peculiar of MoM discretization can be overcome
with the Contrast Source-Extended Born (CS-EB) method. It is an
alternative full-wave integral equation approach proposed by Isernia et
al. [8] for free space scattering problems, and extended by Crocco et al.
[9] to the analysis of two-dimensional subsurface scattering problems.
In the CS-EB method a rewriting of the traditional integral equation of
two-dimensional scattering problems in terms of the so-called ContrastSource equation is performed, exploiting the properties of Green’s
function in lossy media. Then, the obtained equation is linearized via
series expansions, in a way very similar to the EB approximation. In
111

111

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

this new approach, forward scattering problems can be conveniently
solved by means of very simple series expansions, which allow a lower
computational complexity and memory storage with respect to other
iterative schemes.
The scenario analyzed by the CS-EB in [9] considers two half-spaces
separated by a planar interface, and one or more targets are buried in
the lower medium. A multistatic/multiview configuration is used, with
NT time-harmonic TM-polarized line sources located along a rectilinear
domain T at a distance yT from the interface, and NR elementary probes
displaced along the rectilinear domain R at distance yR (see Fig. 1 in
[9]).
The CS-EB model can be applied both to forward and inverse
scattering problems. In case of direct scattering, the CS-EB model
turned out to be particularly advantageous in the simulation of losses
in the embedding medium and/or in the target.

IV. ANALYTICAL APPROACHES
Analytical approaches for the solution of forward electromagnetic
scattering by buried objects must be able to simultaneously copy with
different geometries, i.e., one or more planar boundaries and the shape
relevant to the buried scatterers.
An analytical approach solving a wide class of scattering problems is
the Cylindrical Wave Approach (CWA), proposed by Frezza et al. [10]. In
this pioneering on CWA, the problem of plane-wave scattering by
perfectly-conducting (PEC) circular cross-section cylinders buried in a
semi-infinite medium is solved. The total field in each medium is
decomposed into field contributions, produced by the interaction
between the incident field with the interface and the cylinder. They are
distinguished in plane-wave fields and scattered field contributions,
belonging to the latter group the field scattered by the buried targets in
the lower medium, and the scattered-reflected and scatteredtransmitted fields dealing with the interaction between the scattered
field and the interface. The fundamentals of the technique are the use of
cylindrical waves as basis functions of the scattered fields, and of planewave spectrum of a cylindrical wave to solve reflection and
transmissions of such waves by a planar interface.
An accurate integration algorithm has been developed for the
numerical solution of the spectral integrals relevant to the cylindrical
waves used as basis function of the scattered fields. The resulting
numerical code implementing the CWA theory is fast and accurate,
leading to results both in near- and far-field regions.
The rigorous CWA formulation has paved the way to a successful
extension of the method to more complex scenarios of scattering by
buried objects, dealing with layered media, rough surfaces, or the
excitation from a line-source.
In the above mentioned problems, checks based on the Same Area
Rule (with PEC scatterers) and Same Volume Rule (with dielectric
112

112

TUD COST Action TU1208

scatterers) have highlighted the possibility to simulate cylinders with
arbitrary cross-section, through suitable arrangements of smaller
cylinders.
A fundamental improvement to the CWA has been given with the
development of a solution for cylindrical waves in a dissipative medium
[11], which has been implemented in the case of scatterers buried below
a flat interface in a semi-infinite medium.
On the side of three-dimensional scattering problems, a recent work
has been published on the scattering of an elliptically polarized plane
wave by a sphere buried in a dielectric half-space [12]. The electric field
components of the incident and the scattered monochromatic plane
waves have been expanded in series of vectorial spherical harmonics. A
generalization of the method to the case of a short pulse scattered by a
buried sphere has been presented, taking into account the dispersive
properties of the involved media.

V. CONCLUSION
In this review paper the main approaches to the forward solution of
scattering by buried objects have been recalled. In the presented works,
a strong effort is devoted to implement accurate electromagnetic tools
for the modeling of general scattering scenarios, with a particular
interest in the field of GPR applications.
Among the possible techniques, FDTD turns out to be the most
versatile for the simulation of complex problems, in terms of
background and target geometry, and source modeling. Its main
limitations are in the execution times and memory requirements
relevant to high computational domains, and in the staircase
approximation of curved scatterers. With targets of canonical shape,
analytical and integral equation approaches may lead to a faster as well
as accurate solution. An example is the wire antenna method, efficient
in the simulation of buried pipes or power cables. The integral equation
approach solved with the CS-BE method is an advantageous method in
the simulation of targets buried in a lossy soil, as its formulation
exploits of the properties of the Green’s function in a dissipative
medium.
Possible developments of this technique may be the extension to
three-dimensional problems and non-homogeneous embedding media.
In the CWA, an open issue is the development of the cylindrical-wave
solution in dissipative media for a wider class of scattering scenarios,
i.e., the problems of targets embedded in layered media, in the rough
surface case, and with the line source excitation. For this particular
source field, a further important advancement in the CWA would be
offered by the development of a solution with a pulsed field. This novel
time-domain approach may be particularly useful in modeling of targets
with curved boundary, which is one the major limitations in FDTD
technique.

Abstract
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a non-destructive imaging technique able to
provide high-resolution images of subsurface. From a theoretical point of view, it
requires to solve an inverse problem, where a set of parameters describing the
underground scenario must be retrieved starting from samples of the measured
electromagnetic field. In this paper, the state of the art of recent inversion
approaches is reported.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of imaging buried targets (subsurface imaging) has been
the subject of a great deal of research as it finds application in a very
large number of research fields (see [1]–[10], for example). In order to
succeed in subsurface imaging a number of requirements must be
complied with and traded off. These include hardware definition, that
should allow for relatively small systems (for portability), ultra-wide
operating bandwidth, low levels of the direct coupling between TX/RX
antennas, antenna characterization in complex media, numerical
modeling, effective forwards solvers and data processing algorithms
[11]–[18]. Concerning data processing, since targets are buried within
an extremely complicated scene (usually inhomogeneous with media
that can be lossy and dispersive), before imaging clutter suppression,
medium estimation and antenna deconvolution are generally needed.
In this contribution we focus only on the imaging procedure. In
particular, a quick overview of different methods of subsurface imaging
is provided within the framework of the electromagnetic scattering
117

equations. First, the very popular migration algorithms are recalled
(Section II). Furthermore, in Section III, the scattering equations are
briefly introduced. It is shown that the subsurface imaging is a special
case of inverse scattering problem. Accordingly, it is a non-linear and
ill-posed problem. Despite of that, we start by presenting imaging
algorithms based on simplified linearized scattering models and
establish a connection with the migration ones. Then a discussion on
non-linear inversion methods follows in Section IV. Section V is devoted
to the description of a more recent class of imaging algorithms, the so
called “qualitative” methods such as linear sampling, MUSIC. etc.
Concluding remarks end the paper.

II. MIGRATION
Migration algorithms basically achieve imaging by re-focalizing
diffraction hyperbolic patterns appearing in the data (B-scan). From the
pioneering work of Hagendoorn [19] a number of different
implementations followed. A non-exhaustive list includes the Wave
Interference Migration [20], the A-scan-driven and the pixel driven
approaches [21], the Diffraction Summation [20], the Range Migration
[22], the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique [21], the F-K Migration
[23] and the Kirchhoff integral equation [24]. The relationship between
these different migration schemes has been recently discussed in [25].
The mathematical rationale of migration is provided by the
homogeneous wave equation in conjunction with the so-called
“exploding source model”. However, this mathematical model internally
contains an implicit contradiction: while the field is back-propagated as
a solution of a homogeneous wave equation the exploding source
assumes it being radiated by a localized source. The extrapolated field
can be also interpreted as a Rayleigh-Sommerfeld hologram that
coincides with the so-called Generalized Holography [26] (when data are
collected over an infinite line). This connection is import because it
establishes, in rigorous way, through the Porter-Bojarski integral
equation, the relationship between the migrated field and the secondary
sources.

III. LINEAR INVERSE SCATTERING APPROACHES
The scattering phenomenon can be described in terms of the LippmannSchwinger system of equations [27]

(1)
where
,
respectively,

and

and

propagation through the relevant Green's functions. Finally,
is the
target contrast function. The reconstruction problem thus consists of
inverting the system of equations (1) for the contrast function once
has been collected. This entails solving a non-linear inverse problem.
The problem can be drastically simplified by invoking some approximate
models (i.e., Born, Rytov [27], Extended Born [17], Kirchhoff [28], etc.)
so that the scattering phenomenon may be modeled through a linear
operator. However, the problem still remains ill-posed. To cope with this
drawback, inversion can be achieved by some regularized scheme.
Basically, regularization consists of replacing an ill-posed problem by a
parameter dependent family of well-posed neighboring problems so that
to establish a compromise between accuracy and stability [29], that is
(2)
where
is the regularized inverse,  is the so-called regularization
parameter, and the noise level. In particular, as
also
and
the regularized reconstruction tends to the generalized inverse. A large
number of regularization methods have been devised. Very popular are
the variational Tikhonov method and the iterative Landweber procedure
[30]. Other methods are based on metric or statistic information criteria
[31]. However, it can be easily show that all of them result in a filtering
of the singular spectrum of the linearized scattering operator. It is clear
that, apart the computational convenience that can dictate the
regularization algorithm to adopt, the key question is the choice of the
regularization parameter. This choice must be done by accounting for
the noise level, the mathematical features of the operator to be inverted
and the available a priori information about the unknown.
Different methods exist to select the regularization parameter. Such
methods can explicitly exploit the knowledge of the noise level, (such as
the Morozov discrepancy principle) or not (such as the generalized cross
validation) [32]. Finally, it can be easily realized that migration
substantially, corresponds to achieve inversion by means of the adjoint
of the linearized scattering operator. This allows to obtain stable
reconstructions, however as pointed out in [25], it is not a regularization
scheme in the sense of Tikhonov and hence an intrinsic limit on the
achievable resolution exists [33].

IV. NON-LINEAR INVERSE SCATTERING APPROACHES
Linear inversion schemes are computationally effective and flexible.
However, they generally allow to retrieve only targets’ geometric
features. In order to obtain “quantitative” reconstructions the nonlinearity of problem must be tackled.

119

120

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

A first step towards this direction is to consider high order Born
models [34], [35]. However, in general the full-nonlinearity must be
addressed.
Nonlinear inversion procedures can be coarsely divided in two main
classes: stochastic and deterministic methods.
As to the first class, the inversion of the scattering equations is recast
as an optimization problem [36], [37] and solved by using stochastic
minimization algorithms, such as genetic or swarm optimization
algorithms. In these methods, a set of trial solution is iteratively
modified (according to some stochastic rule) until the minimum of a
predefined cost function is obtained. The main advantage of these
approaches is that they are in principle able to find the global minimum
of the problem, thus reducing the possibility of obtaining false solutions
[38].
The cost function is usually defined as the difference between the
measured data and the field computed by means of the assumed
propagation model, that is
(3)
where
and
are weights used to adjust the data and state
contributions. In order the avoid considering the internal electric field
as an unknown of the optimization problem, the two scattering
equations can also be combined together in order to obtain a single
non-linear operator
[39]. Moreover, since one of the main
drawbacks of stochastic approaches is the high amount of
computational resources needed to perform the inversion, often only a
limited subset of parameters describing the underground scenario is
reconstructed (e.g., the position, size and dielectric properties of buried
targets [40] or the coefficients of a parametric curve describing the
shape of the object [41]).
Deterministic approaches, on the contrary, start from an initial
solution (usually an empty investigation area if no a-priori information
is available) and iteratively modify the solution according to some
deterministic rule. The main drawback of such class of approaches is
however that they can be trapped in local minima, corresponding to
false solutions. An example of this type of approaches is the distortedBorn iterative method [42], in which the problem is solved by iteratively
constructing a linearized problems by means of the distorted-Born
approximation (at every step it is necessary to solve a direct problem for
updating the Green’s function); the linear problem is then solved by
using a conjugate gradient method.
In [43] an inversion method based on an inner-outer scheme is used;
the outer loop is a Gauss-Newton linearization scheme, whereas in the
inner loop the obtained linearized problem is solved in a regularized
sense by means of a truncated Landweber method. The contrast source
inversion (CSI) method can also be applied. The key advantage of CSI is
that it does not require to solve a full direct problem at every step.
120

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

Different forms of the scattering equations, such as the Contract
Sources–Extended Born one [44], have also been derived in order to
obtain improved reconstruction accuracy.
V. PROJECTION METHOD AND OTHER INVERSION APPROACHES
A further class of imaging methods are the so-called qualitative
methods.
Such methods are non-iterative and require no approximate
scattering models. They aim at recovering the support of the scatterers
by adopting some indicator functions which assume very different
values depending on whether they are evaluated inside or outside the
scatterer domains. Moreover, they do not require the a priori knowledge
of the nature of the scatterers. The linear sampling, the factorization
and the point-source methods are examples of such a type of algorithms
[45]. These algorithms need data to be collected under a
multiview/multistatic configuration and their performance can strongly
decrease for aspect limited measurements and for reduced number of
acquisition [46], [47]. By contrast, they are computationally as effective
as linear methods and work in time-harmonic regime. This allows to
disregard soil dispersive effects and soil characterization over a large
bandwidth. Also the time-reversal-music method is worth mentioning
[48], [49].
Other approaches have been proposed, too.
In [50], [51], the position of a target is detected by estimating the
scattered field directions of arrival through subarrays processing
followed by a statistical filtering and a triangularization technique. In
[52] an artificial neural network, trained with a hybrid optimization
algorithm that is a combination of intelligent global harmony search
and Levenberg–Marquardt algorithms, is used to mimic the
electromagnetic tomography system.
Real-time detection and classification of multiple scatterers below the
air-soil interface has also been investigated by using learning-byexamples (LBE) techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM)
[53].
A further class of data processing algorithms fall within the
framework of the sparse minimization borrowed from compressive
sensing literature.
This class of approaches are particularly suited for scatterers that
project over a low dimensional "dictionary". In these cases, imaging can
be cast as the inversion of an underdetermined matrix by adopting
minimization in
functional spaces [54]. Inversion procedures based
on Bayesian Compressive Sampling (BCS) have been presented [55].
These techniques are able to provide satisfactory reconstructions in
correspondence with single and multiple sparse scatterers, showing a
remarkable robustness to noise and computational efficiency. However,
the regularization parameters must be selected properly [56].

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, an overview of some recent methods for subsurface
imaging has been presented. Such approaches have been assuming an
ever growing importance, thanks to ability of providing quantitative
information about buried targets. However, due to the non-linearity and
ill-posedness of the underlying inverse scattering problem, theoretical
and implementation issues can still occurs, leading to the need of
further enhancing present approaches and exploring new solution
paradigms.

Abstract
Proper description of antenna effects on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data
generally relies on numerical methods such as the Method of Moments (MoM) or
Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) modeling approaches. Yet, numerical
methods are computationally expansive and accurate reproduction of real
measurements has remained a challenge for many years. Recently, intrinsic
modeling approaches, through which radar antennas are effectively described
using their fundamental features, have demonstrated great promise for nearfield radar antenna modeling. Although such approaches are not suited for
designing radar antennas, they are particularly powerful for fast and accurate
modeling, which is a prerequisite when full-wave inversion is applied, e.g., for
estimating medium electrical properties. These approaches are also of great
interest for filtering out antenna effects from measured radar data for improved
subsurface imaging.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for nondestructive imaging and
characterization of the subsurface has been subject to intensive
research for many years [1]–[4]. A major shortcoming in current
knowledge is the modeling of the radar signal, which is necessary for
quantitative reconstruction using full-wave inversion. Existing
techniques usually rely strongly on simplifying assumptions regarding
electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena, and in particular,
neglect antenna effects, which include frequency-dependent radiation
pattern, gain, phase delay, mutual coupling, and coupling with the
medium of interest. GPR antennas determine the frequency-dependent
fields that are transmitted into the subsurface and affect as well the
backscattered fields that are measured. In this paper, a general
overview of antenna modeling methods is presented and insights are
provided for future lines of research.

II. NUMERICAL METHODS
Radar antennas can be modeled using numerical approaches, such as
the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [5]–[8], the finite
element method (FEM) [9], [10], or the method of moments (MoM) [11],
[12]. Yet, numerical approaches need significant computing resources to
reproduce 3-D models and suffer from inherent differences between the
real and conceptualized antenna models due to the discretization and
sensitivity to small differences between the model and the reality: the
computational domain needs to be modeled in detail [13]. For instance,
Warren and Giannopoulos [6] used a 3-D FDTD approach through
which the different parts of transmitting and receiving bowtie antennas
were reproduced in the discretized model.
Although relatively good modeling results were obtained for data
collected over different emulsions, still significant modeling errors could
be observed. These issues can be addressed through the
implementation of subgrids into the conventional FDTD mesh to
simultaneously account for antenna details and economize on
computational resources [14]. Pantoja et al. [15] extended a MoM in the
time domain for the transient analysis of thin-wire antennas located
over a lossy half-space. Numerical analyses showed good results for
near-field cases, but where the antenna was not too close to a halfspace medium.

III. EFFECTIVE OR INTRINSIC METHODS
More efficient techniques are based on electric field integral equation
(EFIE) formulations [16]–[22], through which, for the particular case of
antennas, a set of infinitesimal electric dipoles and field points is used.
The parameterization of these dipoles to properly describe real antenna
radiation patterns is, however, not straightforward [17], [23]. In
addition, such formulations do not directly account for wave
propagation between the source or field points and the radar
transmission line reference plane, i.e., where the field is actually
measured, and hence, antenna-medium interactions and mutual
coupling are not directly accounted for. For instance, Gentili and
Spagnolini [24] modeled a GPR horn antenna at some distance over a 3D layered medium using an array of frequency-independent source
dipoles and a feeding line characteristic impedance. Yet, with this
approach the multiple reflections between the antenna terminal section
and the medium were not accounted for. Slob and Fokkema [25] used a
thin-wire approximation to study the effects of two antennas placed
close together on the Earth's surface, and in particular, investigate the
coupling between the antennas. They observed that the coupling is not
negligible for GPR applications. The influence of the half-space medium

128

on antenna behavior is strong but limited to a fraction of the
wavelength in depth.
For the particular case of far-field GPR with applications to planar
layered media, Lambot et al. [26] proposed a closed-form, frequencydomain, radar equation that simultaneously accounts for: 1) all
antenna effects through frequency-dependent global reflection and
transmission coefficients and 2) wave propagation in layered media
through 3-D Green's functions. This intrinsic antenna-medium model
relies on the assumption that the spatial distribution of the
backscattered field locally tends to a plane wave over the antenna
aperture, which is asymptotically valid in far-field conditions. The model
has demonstrated an unprecedented accuracy for describing radar data
and retrieving medium electrical properties, including frequency
dependence, in a series of hydrogeophysical and engineering
applications [26]–[29]. In addition, the validity of that model being
theoretically independent of frequency and antenna type, the approach
also applies to electromagnetic induction (EMI), i.e., in the kHz
frequency ranges where diffusive phenomena are dominant. In that
respect, Moghadas et al. [30] successfully applied this model to a loop
antenna operating in the 30-60 kHz range for soil electrical conductivity
determination. Whether for GPR or EMI, it was observed that the socalled far-field condition for the planar field approximation holds when
the distance between the antenna and the medium is larger than the
antenna aperture dimension. For subsurface characterization and
imaging, the far-field condition however strongly limits resolution and
penetration depth.
More recently, by resorting to the superposition principle, the farfield model of Lambot et al. [26] was generalized to near field conditions
[31]. With this approach, the radar antennas are described using an
equivalent set of infinitesimal electric dipoles and characteristic,
frequency-dependent, global reflection, and transmission coefficients
(complex valued). These coefficients determine through a planar field
decomposition over the antenna aperture wave propagation between the
radar reference plane, point sources, and field points. The interactions
between the antenna and layered medium, i.e., antenna-medium
coupling, are thereby inherently accounted for. Hence, the antenna
characteristic functions are independent of the medium. The fields are
calculated using 3-D Green's functions for wave propagation in planar
layered media. The model was successfully validated using both
ultrawideband frequency- and time-domain radars. Yet, it is worth
noting that this approach only applies to planar layered media (at least
locally).
Considering buried objects or more complex structures in the
subsurface still requires further developments. This closed-form
modeling approach can, however, be integrated with numerical
formulations such as FDTD or other EFIE-based methods that
efficiently scattering by an embedded object.

IV. CONCLUSION
In this review paper the main approaches to the forward modeling of
GPR antennas have been briefly summarized and their importance has
been emphasized. A strong requirement is the accurate modeling of the
radar data for quantitative reconstruction of medium properties or
embedded objects using full-wave inversion as well as for improved
radar imaging by removing artifacts that arise from the antenna effects,
such as multiple reflections. Each approach shows advantages and
limitations, but they are ways that are possible for the development of
hybrid methods that should be designed to tackle specific problems and
provide an optimal tradeoff between model accuracy, complexity and
computational cost. Although available computing resources are ever
increasing, inverse scattering problems are usually very demanding and
practical applications still need new solutions in that respect.

Abstract
The design of GPR data processing tools aimed at reconstructing in a
quantitative way the characteristic features of a monitored region is an open
and challenging issue. This not trivial task requires the development of imaging
techniques based on sophisticated models capable of properly describing the
involved scattering phenomenon as well as the probing wavelet. This paper
aims at describing briefly some of the most relevant advancements reached in
the last years. Moreover, some open challenges are traced in order to give some
hints to address future works.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At microwaves, signal-media interactions are mainly sensitive to
electromagnetic parameters and diagnostic technologies working in this
frequency range, as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems, are in
principle able to quantitatively image these characteristic features of the
probed scene [1], [2]. However, retrieving reliable and accurate
information on geometrical and electromagnetic parameters from the
scattered field data is still an open issue. This is due to the fact that
propagation of microwaves in heterogeneous media is a complex
phenomenon governed by diffraction rules and scattering interactions
across many scales. Therefore, sophisticated models of the involved
scattering phenomena are needed to properly describe the data. In
addition, because surface data contains subsurface information from
one-sided illumination, the non-linear inverse scattering problem is illposed and non-unique [3]. This introduces complications related to false
solutions, stability, and accuracy of the results that must be tackled [3],
133

TUD COST Action TU1208

[4]. The idea to reconstruct the characteristic features of a scene from
the waves it scatters, when probed with an interrogating electric field,
has been widely considered in the last thirty years and a large number
of approaches have been proposed [4]. However, only few of them have
been applied and assessed in GPR data processing, which is principally
focused on filtering and migration techniques [1], [2].
Nowadays, the continuous advancements in computational
resources allow using model based approaches, while respecting the
constraint to keep the processing time bearable and ensuring the
reliability of the results (i.e., absence of false solutions). In addition the
new generation of GPR systems exploiting an antenna array introduces
the possibility to probe and observe a scene under different angles. In
this way an increased amount of independent information can be
gathered during a single survey without impairing the acquisition time.
These two innovations open the way for new prospective GPR
applications. These also motivate an increasing interest in adopting
inverse scattering algorithms able to provide high-resolution
quantitative images of the investigated scenario.
The inverse scattering literature being remarkably wide, this paper
does not aim at providing a complete review, but only a rough snapshot
of some of the most valuable shape reconstruction methods and fullwave procedures proposed in the last years. Some open challenges are
highlighted in the Conclusions.

II. SHAPE RECONSTRUCTION METHODS
Shape reconstruction methods belong to the class of the so-called
qualitative imaging procedures and are classifiable in techniques based
on approximated scattering models and in methods based on exact
models but aimed at retrieving only targets location and support.
The first family has been widely considered in GPR surveys and
groups all those procedures based on Born and Kirchhoff
approximation, such as those given in [5]–[13]. Currently, there are
many examples assessing the performance of these approaches in field
conditions, hence they can be considered as mature tools ready to be
integrated in the frame of standard data processing chains.
The second kind of approaches, instead, is less common in GPR
community and involves imaging strategies as those based on level set
theory and the linear sampling method.
Recently, level set theory has received a growing attention in those
applications where electromagnetic properties of both scatterers and
surrounding media are a priori known. Therefore, the imaging can be
accurately formulated as the problem to reconstruct the unknown
parameters describing location and contour topology of the scatterers. A
pioneering approach to retrieve the unknown cross section of a
homogeneous cylinder embedded in a homogeneous medium has been
134

given in [14], while the case of a cylindrical object buried in a half-space
has been faced in [15]. Shape reconstruction of 3D penetrable and PEC
objects has been also considered [16], [17]. In addition, methodologies
integrating a multi-scale strategy and a level-set imaging technique
have been proposed in order to exploit the information collectable from
scattering experiments as well as available a priori knowledge on the
scattering object under test [18], [19].
The linear sampling method (LSM) is an imaging approach worth to
be considered, since it is able to retrieve the support of single or
multiple scatterers without involving approximated models or a priori
knowledge on the dielectric or metallic nature of the objects to be
imaged. The applicability of the LSM in those cases wherein a
theoretical proof is still missing is supported by its physical
interpretations [20]–[23]. On the other hand, despite its advantages in
term of simple implementation and computational efficiency, the use of
the LSM is at this time notably limited. This is due to the fact that data
gathered under a multi-view multi-static antenna arrangements are
needed and the reconstruction capabilities dramatically deteriorate with
decreasing number of sources and measurement points. The
applicability of LSM in GPR surveys has been discussed in [24], where
the conditions under which LSM can provide satisfactory results while
keeping low the complexity of the measurement system, have been
investigated.
Another very suitable technique when multi-view data is available is
the wave field imaging technique, which extrapolates total wave fields to
the image locations. Because this can be done recursively, it is a highly
efficient method and is routinely used since the early 1990’s, e.g., [25].

III. FULL-WAVE INVERSION STRATEGIES
Full wave inversion strategies are those imaging approaches aimed at
reconstructing from the measured scattered field data dielectric
permittivity and electric conductivity spatial profiles characterizing the
investigated domain. The magnetic permeability is taken as a constant
with the free-space value. Such a task is often faced by solving an
optimization problem where the unknown parameters are iteratively
retrieved by minimizing a cost functional, which expresses the distance
in the data space between the gathered data and the modeled data [4].
Based on the adopted optimization scheme, these full wave
inversion strategies can be classified in stochastic and deterministic
ones. The first class adopts a global optimization scheme and offers the
advantage to assure the convergence at the global minimum provided
that a low number of unknowns need to be found. Therefore, their
applicability is feasible only in those few cases wherein the scene to be
imaged is actually described by a limited number of unknowns. A
review dealing with the use of stochastic approaches with reference to
135

135

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

different reconstruction modalities, including tomography, buried object
detection, and borehole sensing has been given in [26].
The second class is, instead, based on local optimization, such as
the conjugate gradient algorithm, and suffers from the fact that the
procedure can be trapped in local minima, which are indeed false
solutions of the problem [4], [27]. As a consequence, a suitable starting
guess and/or refined regularization procedures have to be adopted in
order to assure the reliability of the results [28]. An interesting state of
art assessing the potentiality of these approaches as tools to
reconstruct unknown permittivity and conductivity profiles can be
found in [29]–[31], where the performances of several full wave inversion
strategies have been assessed against the same datasets measured in
laboratory-controlled conditions. In particular, in [29], [30] the imaging
problem has been faced under the 2D scalar assumption, while the 3D
vector nature of the scattering phenomenon has been tackled in [31].
While a large amount of promising results are available for the case
of targets completely surrounded by the antennas and hosted in a
known homogeneous medium, only few and preliminary studies are
referred to aspect-limited data, as in on-ground or cross-hole GPR
surveys. Moreover, large part of these studies deal with synthetic
experiments [32]–[35]. An example referred to laboratory data has been
given in [36], where it has been shown that, even if a rough model of the
scattering phenomenon is considered, an accurate quantitative
characterization of a hidden target is still possible provided that a priori
knowledge on its nature is available and the hosting medium is known.
One of the first examples devoted to reconstruct the permittivity
profile of a layered medium by experimental data has been presented in
[37]. In this paper, the conductivity has been supposed to be known, an
1D geometry as well as an off-ground monostatic commercial GPR
system have been adopted. In addition, the probing wavelet has been
modeled by exploiting the plane wave approximation.
A first major advancement in the imaging of both dielectric
permittivity and electric conductivity has been given in [38], where a
laboratory realized off-ground monostatic GPR system has been used
and a full-wave inversion method exploiting a sophisticated model of the
probing wavelet has been proposed and validated against experimental
data. Recent relevant contributions have been provided in [39]–[42]. In
[39] a full-wave inversion scheme based on a 2D finite-difference time
domain scattering model has been proposed to process cross-hole GPR
data. Such an approach has been extended to the 3D vectorial case [40]
and applied to process experimental cross-hall data [41]. In [42] a full
wave inversion procedure to elaborate frequency domain data gathered
under a common-midpoint measurement configuration has been
considered. The peculiarity of such a procedure is that the amplitude
and phase of the probing wavelet is optimized simultaneously with
dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity of a single layered
subsurface.
136

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

Further works addressing the problem to achieve a quantitative
characterization of the surveyed medium are [43]–[47]. In particular, the
problem to detect and characterize a thin delamination layer in concrete
slabs has been discussed in [43], where the antenna effects are filtered
from the measured data with an antenna calibration procedure, and in
[44], where the effect of the probing antenna has been modeled in the
inversion. In [45], a simple technique to estimate soil parameters from
multistatic GPR data, which is based on an integral linear equation
relating the field reflected from the air-soil interface to the Fresnel
reflection coefficient, has been described and preliminary validated
against synthetic data. In [46], [47] the problem to characterize the
dispersive behavior of concrete media has been faced by exploiting the
Jonscher parameterization of the permittivity. In particular, several
variants of the Jonscher model, each one considering just few
parameters (not more than four), have been compared in [46]. Herein, a
computationally efficient two-step procedure for estimating the four
model parameters has been also proposed together with a parametric
study aimed at correlating the dispersion parameters with physical and
hydric characteristics of concrete mixture. In [47], an algorithm devoted
to estimate time delays and dispersion indices of a stratified medium,
which exploits the Jonscher parameterization, has been introduced and
validated against synthetic and experimental data.
Finally, imaging approaches based on the Bayesian theory are worth
mentioning wherein the solution of the inverse problem is given as a
probability density function. In this frame, considerable contributions
have been recently proposed with respect to cross-hole GPR data [48]
and under the hypothesis of single and multiples sparse targets [49],
[50]. In this latter case, the proposed approaches offer imaging
capabilities, which positively compare with standard deterministic
conjugate gradient procedures in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
robustness against noise and computational efficiency.

IV. CONCLUSION
Motivated by the advancements in computational resources and the
development of new generations of GPR systems an increasing attention
is currently addressed on model based imaging approaches. However,
their profitable use in GPR applications requires facing several
challenges leading to a formidable task ahead.
The necessity to characterize the background in complex scenarios
and to model accurately the probing wavelet are among the most
relevant open issues. These are key elements in the formulation of
inverse scattering problems. In addition, a study devoted at assessing
how uncertainties in the background and probing wavelet affect the
imaging capabilities is worth mentioning.

A further key challenge concerns the necessity to properly account
for the ill-posedness and non-linearity of the inverse problem, while
assuring the reliability of the results and their stability against noise. In
particular, finding the factors that affect the degree of non-linearity
could result in a valuable breakthrough for the design of advanced
imaging and inversion approaches and for optimizing measurement
configurations, capable of increasing the amount of information in the
gathered data, while keeping the complexity of the hardware devices
feasible. These topics have been tackled in part in the inverse scattering
literature, so a possible starting point could be the study of previously
proposed methodologies and their adaptation to GPR imaging problems.
Finally, since the reconstruction capabilities of large part of the model
based approaches proposed for GPR data processing have been
preliminary assessed only on synthetic data, their validation on
experimental data is mandatory first for data obtained in controlled
conditions followed by data obtained in real conditions. To achieve this,
the availability of datasets to be used as a common benchmark could be
helpful to assess and compare the achievable performances.

Abstract
Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a nondestructive geophysical method that
uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. Notwithstanding it is particularly
promising for soil characteristics interpretation, GPR is characterized by a
notoriously difficult automated data analysis. Hence, the focus of this paper is
to provide the reader with a deep understanding of the state of the art and open
issues in the field of GPR data processing techniques. We present an overview
on noise suppression, deconvolution, migration, attribute analysis and
visualization techniques for GPR data.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) mainly consists of a radar device
which transmits and receives electromagnetic pulses into the
subsurface. GPR applications include sedimentology, ground water
contamination, glaciology, archaeology and geotechnical engineering [1].
GPR proves to be very useful in road monitoring applications [2]–[5],
pipes, cables, tunnels and other buried objects delineation [6], railways
ballast condition monitoring [7], [8], concrete structures inspection and
bridge deck inspection [9], buried archaeological ruins mapping [10]
and many other relevant applications which have already been applied
or are to come in the future.
Here, we will discuss the development of GPR data processing
techniques for geotechnical applications. We will present the basic and
commonly used signal processing techniques and focus mainly on the
enhancement of the GPR signal by advanced signal processing methods

143

143

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

like denoising, deconvolution, migration and attribute analysis as well
as visualization of GPR data.

II. GPR DATA SIGNAL PROCESSING
Accepting the fact that GPR measurements are dense enough for the
delineation of the target and the optimum frequency is selected [11],
processing should enhance the GPR signal providing sufficient
interpretation. The GPR data processing consists of time-zero
corrections, dewow, band pass filtering, spatial filters and gain.
Drift of the zero time along the profile can occur due to temperature
difference between the instrument electronics and the air temperature
or damaged cables. This drift causes misalignment of the reflections
and the zero time has to be reset for all traces along the profile [1].
Dewow removes the low frequency harmonics caused by
electromagnetic induction. Many automatic algorithms exist for
dewowing but, even though they correct for the low frequency undesired
harmonics, they sometimes can cause reverberations. Thus, band-pass
or time varying low cut filtering can solve this problem [12]. Spatial
filters are mainly used for muting specific form of reflections (horizontal
or dipping). The most commonly used gain functions are exponential
gain (SEC) and windowed gain functions (AGC). SEC, even though
keeps information which is lost by AGC, also slightly alters the shape of
the wavelet making it time varying [11]. AGC on the other hand even
though enhances low amplitudes, it can be misleading because they
also enhance unwanted information and loose the initial spatial relation
of amplitudes.
The GPR data processing can also include the following techniques:
Time varying band-pass filtering [13]–[15], time and frequency analysis
[14]-[16], deconvolution [17]–[22], velocity analysis [23]–[25] and
migration [26], [27] as well as attribute analysis [28]–[31]. The main
purpose of all the above is enhancing the signal in order to interpret the
GPR sections.

III. GPR DATA NOISE SUPPRESSION
Discarding background noise improves visual quality of the reflections
of interest [32]. Noise will both affect deconvolution and migration
techniques. A number of filtering techniques have been proposed to
enhance the SNR of the GPR data. However, most techniques are
developed to suppress coherent noise [33]–[36], but there are not many
publications related to removing incoherent noise [15], [37]. The
simplest way of suppressing random noise is stacking. Simple stacking
does not always result in satisfactory improvement of the signal due to
amplitude fluctuations between the stacked signals mostly because to
144

144

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

DC quantization errors and imperfect alignment related to
synchronization errors when sampling [38]. The authors in [15] utilized
user defined time varying band pass filters. Noise suppression can be
achieved by: (i) Stacking using local correlation [39]; (ii) Empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) [40] and [41] and (iii) Smoothing of the spectrum
[42], [43].

IV. DECONVOLUTION
Deconvolution is the process needed to improve the temporal resolution
in order to clearly visualize the reflections of interest [20]. A
deconvolution algorithm should extract the reflectivity series and thus
to improve the temporal resolution and facilitate quantitative data
interpretation [18]. It is well understood that increased resolution is
necessary in geotechnical GPR data. One reason for that is the
reduction of the number of involved antennas. If deconvolution
satisfactory improves the resolution for the relatively low frequency
antennas, which penetrate deeper and have stronger response [2], the
higher frequency antennas may prove to be unnecessary. Additionally
there is a need for distinguishing overlapping reflections in the GPR
sections for any antenna’s dominant frequency.
Despite the popularity of GPR reflection, successful deconvolution
applications to GPR data are very rare (e.g., [17], [44], [45]). The authors
in [18] and in [22] performed blind deconvolution to GPR data. GPR
data time varying deconvolution related to geotechnical engineering was
also applied in [21], in order to successfully increase the bandwidth and
hence the temporal resolution of the time series. Deconvolution of GPR
data has been notoriously unsuccessful for many years mainly due to
the non-stationarity of the GPR traces and the mixed phase EM
wavelets [19]. Even though [16], [44] and [46] presented ways for inverse
Q filtering, in most of the cases this inverse Q filter suffers in the
estimation of an apparent Q value [14]. The authors in [15] developed a
narrow time-window methodology applied in the t-f domain [47] for
spectral balancing [48], [49]. Furthermore, wavelet deconvolution is
successful when applied after spectral balancing and followed by the
application of the maximum kurtosis method [19], [20], [50]–[54].

V. MIGRATION
Migration is a method which moves events to their correct time or
spatial locations and collapses energy from diffractions back to their
scattering points. Until three decades ago, migration was the final
processing step for seismics [55]. Today, migrated data almost always
provide input for several steps such as detailed analysis of attributes
and signal processing methods like deconvolution. The authors in [56]

presented an improved Stolt migration algorithm for relatively
homogeneous velocity media. A split-step migration technique was
implemented in [26] in order to account for dispersion effects, while the
authors in [57] implemented a finite element migration method which
incorporates attenuation. The insufficient application of migration of
GPR data is mainly due to the inability to estimate an accurate velocity
model. This is mainly the problem for seismics also [55]. For the
successful application of GPR data migration multi-fold data must be
acquired [23]-[25], [31], [58]-[60]. Migration can be considered as a
smoothing technique which alters the amplitude spectrum by lowering
the dominant frequency. This results in a low resolution migrated
section [61]. So, consideration should be taken in order to apply postmigration deconvolution methods by treating the amplitude and phase
spectrum separately [62], [63].

VI. ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
Attribute analysis and classification are useful for the interpretation of
GPR data. There are 5 main categories of attributes:
1. Instantaneous attributes ensure the local information and are
calculated via Hilbert transform.
2. Wavelet attributes are computed at the peak of the envelope [64].
3. Texture attributes describe the data samples, through gray-level cooccurrence matrices [65], [66].
4. Geometrical-statistical attributes are calculated directly from the
data, within a spatiotemporal sliding window.
5. Coherency-semblance attributes provide spatiotemporal relations of
the dataset [67].
The authors in [29] used attributes and Self Organizing Maps to
interpret GPR data. The authors in [30] utilized the same tools to map a
three arched roman cistern and the ducts which supply water to the
cistern, [31] focused on archaeological investigations, while [66] utilizes
geometrical attributes for the visualization of active faults.
Other classification techniques are based on the exploitation of
Learning-by-Example (LBE) strategies for the detection and
classification of buried objects by using Support Vector Machines [67]
or Support Vector Regression [68]. Great efforts have been also devoted
towards the development of inversion techniques able to profitably
combine global and local search approaches with multi-focusing
strategies, such as the Iterative Multi Scaling Approach [69] or imaging
approaches based on Bayesian Compressive Sensing [70], [71] and
Interval Analysis [72]. Finally, specific processing has been recently
developed, including the Jonscher parameterization of the medium [73]
or the so-called a transparent 3D half bird’s-eye view of the GPR data
volume or its sub-volumes [74]–[77].

VII. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a review of GPR data processing techniques needed
for geotechnical applications. We have focused mainly on the
enhancement of the GPR signal by signal processing methods like
denoising,
deconvolution,
migration
and
attribute
analysis.
Notwithstanding this research area has already been well studied by
many researchers, more is needed and even more is expected from
automatic GPR data analysis.

Abstract
This paper is concerned with a brief review of the recent advances related to the
use of GPR and its integration with other techniques in the applicative domain of
the archaeological prospecting and cultural heritage diagnostics and monitoring.
In particular, the main scientific/technological challenges are identified and
possible strategies to tackle them are devised with a particular interest to the
role that the COST Action TU1208 could play.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) represents a well assessed technology,
of huge interest in all those applicative contexts where non-invasive
diagnostic surveys are required, such as infrastructure and cultural
heritage monitoring as well as archaeological and subsurface
prospecting [1]–[3]. In fact, non-invasive diagnostic tools, as GPR, offer
the significant advantage to gather information about not directly
accessible objects, such as undiscovered targets, building inner
features, non-homogeneities and/or fractures affecting the integrity of
monuments, in a quick way and without performing any invasive action
on the surveyed area.
As well known, GPR is an active electromagnetic imaging technology
for in situ surveys, which allows us to achieve images with a resolution
from centimeters to few meters) of the inside of the investigated region.
The usual result of a GPR measurement is usually given a 2D map,
known as B-scan, from which expert user may detect and localize
hidden objects and infer information about their geometrical features
[1]–[3].
By turning to the specific area of the archaeological prospecting and
cultural heritage diagnostics, the first advantage of the GPR
instrumentation resides in the moderate cost and easiness of employ; in
fact no significant expertise is required to collect the data. Secondly, the
155

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

instrumentation is easily portable (unless very low frequencies are
exploited with a consequent increase of the antennas size) and allows to
survey regions even of many hundreds of square meters in a reasonable
time. Finally, the flexibility of the GPR system, in terms of a trade-off
between spatial resolution and investigated depth, is ensured by the
adoption of antennas, working at different frequency band, which can
be easily changed on site.
Despite of its widespread applicability, several efforts are
continuously addressed towards the optimization of GPR systems so to
comply with the end-users necessities. From the point of view of the
end-users (archaeologists, cultural heritage stakeholders,..), the first
requirement is to manage different “objects” in terms of size,
construction details, investigation depth and so on. Furthermore, as
other desirable feature, GPR should be able to act in all the phases of
the life cycle of the cultural heritage, from the discovery to the
preservation and conservation, to the fruition; in addition, it is desirable
to use GPR as a tool for fast inspections during the crisis events
(earthquakes, floods, terroristic attacks..).
These end-users necessities demand for the use of GPR as a tool
embedded
in
an
integrated
approach,
where
the
global
vision/observation technologies (as optical/radar technologies from
satellite, airborne platforms) [4]–[6] are able to perform a very large scale
survey and after drive the in-situ inspections, based not only on GPR
but even on other geophysical/sensing techniques. In this way, it is also
possible to achieve a monitoring, which is multi-scale in both spatial
and temporal dimensions.
Another specific GPR requirement regards the improvement of the
interpretability of the radar images, so that the information is rendered
to the stakeholders in a friendly, interpretable and useful way. This is
important for different aims such as: to ensure an always updated
current monitoring; to help the crisis management; to improve the
discovery and fruition. In this context, the final objective should be to
translate the GPR outcomes in indexes and images truly supporting the
vulnerability assessment of the heritage.
All the above sketched for end-users necessities should be
translated in scientific and technological challenges, which demand for
advances in hardware and data processing of GPR as well as for the
integration with other sensing techniques.

II. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES
As outlined in the Section above, several scientific and technological
challenges have to be faced for a truly successful and useful use of GPR
in operative conditions.
The first issue regards the improvement and development of novel
hardware with different aims, such as: to speed-up the surveys and
156

cover very large scale areas; to improve radar performances in terms of
sensitivity and clutter rejection; to permit new measurement
configurations also in view of the use of advanced data processing
approaches. For a large scale survey, it is necessary to conjugate the
requirements of a good portability/usability of the radar system with
the possibilities of using antenna arrays for a multiple acquisitions [7]–
[9]. Interesting cases of this strategy are depicted in [10]–[13], regarding
large scale archaeological surveys in view of an effective 3D pseudorepresentation of the site. Still for the hardware, another recent advance
regards the development of novel GPR systems based on stepped
frequency and CW modulation techniques [14], [15], as well as
differential systems [16], for an improved clutter rejection and
sensitivity; very recent efforts have been performed also in the field of
reconfigurable systems able to manage different operative situations in
a flexible and automatic way [17].
Other advances regard the adoption of antenna arrays able to deal
with measurement configurations different from the monostatic one. In
fact, the use of arrays enabling multi-view/multi-static/multipolarization observations allows not only to enrich the dataset and
improve the qualitative reconstruction [18], [19], but even to activate
sophisticated data processing for a reconstruction of the
electromagnetic properties of the targets [20], [21].
Finally, very recent advances are concerned with the development
and use of GPR system on airborne/helicopter platforms; these systems
are already used in other application domains [22] but the extension to
the archaeology and cultural heritage is on-going [23].
The other main challenge regards the data processing, for which we
can identify two main classes of approaches: linear inversion
approaches for a qualitative reconstruction (location and geometry of
the targets); non-linear reconstruction approaches for a quantitative
estimation of the electromagnetic properties of the targets.
The imaging approaches as migration, back-propagation, and more
generally linear inverse scattering approaches, [24]–[26] are now usually
employed and assessed in realistic conditions for the practical
advantage to provide processed images of the investigated scene in a
short time and with good reliability. Despite of the well assessed use of
these approaches, many challenges are still present as the possibility of
dealing with non-canonical geometries (different from the half-space
geometry) as the curved surfaces and layered media. In fact, the
available commercial codes for GPR data processing are essentially
based on migration approach, which assumes a flat air-medium
interface and homogeneous regions. It is worth noting the flexibility of
the inverse scattering approaches to take easily account the complexity
of the scenarios [27]; in addition, the use of very efficient numerical
forward modeling represents a good option to build the key elements of
the inversion approaches and improve the interpretability of the results
[28], [29].

The other main issue for the imaging approaches regards the
development of 3D full reconstruction algorithms, for an improved
performances compared to the usual strategy, where a pseudo 3D
representation is achieved by building a data volume starting from the
single reconstructed/measured profiles [30]. This scientific advance is a
really hot topic, as testified by many present efforts not only for the
development of the approaches but even for their experimentation in
real situations [31], [32]. Associated to the above sketched imaging
strategies, a recent interest is towards the development of change
detection approaches in order to monitor the cultural heritage by
comparing, possibly in an automatic way, the GPR measured
data/processed images achieved at different times [33].
For reconstruction approaches, one of the scientific challenges
regards the development, and more important, the use on-field of nonlinear inversion approaches. In fact, these approaches are able to
overcome the main limitations of the imaging approaches as to neglect
mutual interactions between the targets and the impossibility to have
reliable information about the EM properties [34], [35]. However, the
development of the non-linear inversion approaches entails very
challenging theoretical issues [36], which, at this moment, make it not
possible their use on field. Besides the mathematical challenges, a
reliable application of this kind of approaches needs of an accurate
estimation of the background scenario and of the antenna radiation in
presence of the investigated structure [37]. Anyway, the use of these
non-linear inversion approaches represents a decisive advance for the
accurate imaging of layered media (masonries) when the a-priori
information about the scenario is poor or missing.
Another topic of great interest is the use of GPR integrated with
other diagnostics/geophysical in-situ techniques. It is worth noting that
the integration strategy depends on the “object” to be investigated. In
fact, for the case of archaeological prospecting, characterized by a not
negligible investigated depth, the most common approach is to exploit
geophysical techniques as EM induction [38], Electrical Resistivity
tomography and GPR, so to make it possible a survey ranging from
large scale to the high resolution diagnostics ensured by the GPR [39]–
[41]. Another example of integrated use of GPR with other techniques is
for vertical structures (masonries, columns,..), where GPR can be used
even in combination with other methods as acoustic ones,
photogrammetry, infrared cameras, hyperspectral imaging, etc. [42]–
[47]. In this context, the effort should be performed in two directions; in
fact, the integrated use of GPR demands for the development of
integration approaches for the data correlation, or, more difficult, based
on physical models of the sensing. The final end is the definition of
observation/sensing protocols, where one can think to use global vision
techniques in order to drive the in-situ techniques for a detailed
inspection of the most interesting areas and/or elements. This strategy
complies with the necessity of the end-users about the economic
158

158

sustainability; in fact, more sophisticated sensing techniques are
activated only in presence of real necessities pointed out by the remote
sensing techniques.
All the above described points are closely related to the last topic,
where research efforts are required as the digitalization and virtual
rendering of non-accessible/excavated sites/objects [48]–[50] (see an
example in Fig. 1). In this case, advances are required not only to
“translate” the geophysical/diagnostics scientific results in images
really understandable by non-expert users as visitors, but also to
improve their sensorial experience. In this frame, 3D digitalised
representation of the non-visible scene should be able to include other
kinds of media contents too (image, audio, video...). For example, the
visitors could find these augmented landmarks disseminated
throughout the archaeological site, urging them to point their mobile
phones at the place where the augmented information sources will be
installed. It is clear how this last point requires a strong
information/knowledge exchange between different worlds as the
sensing/observation technologists/scientists, ICT technologists and the
different end-users communities involved in the cultural heritage.

III.

THE ROLE OF THE COST TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES

The challenges sketched for in the above Section could benefit of the
COST Action TU1208; in particular, besides the effort in the present
Project 4.1, the activities could benefit of the interaction with the other
Working groups and projects especially in the fields of hardware and
data processing advances and the integration with different sensing
technologies in other fields (WG 4).
In this way, the project 4.1 “Applications of gpr and other nondestructive testing methods in archaeological prospecting and cultural
heritage diagnostics” could be the “test bed”, where several outcomes of
the other WGs could be finalized for a real use in operative conditions.
Therefore, Project 4.1 could be very important to provide a feedback
about the true effectiveness of the scientific/technological outcomes of
the COST Action TU1208 in real world for archaeological and cultural
heritage contexts. On the basis of a very preliminary survey among the
participants to the Project 4.1, the main specific challenges that have
been arisen and could be tackled can be summarized as follows.
The development of GPR acquisition and data processing
methodologies for not canonical geometries as in the case of columns
(cylindrical objects), the case of arches and intradoses, and for the case
of not regular surfaces. For this kind of targets, a technological
challenge regards the high precise positioning of the radar systems or at
least the accurate knowledge of the position [51].
This points calls for another challenge regarding the development
and use in real conditions of full 3D reconstruction approaches also in
comparison with the 3D pseudo-representation approaches. This 3D
opportunity should be accompanied by the implementation of
reconstruction approaches able to: give information about the
electromagnetic properties of the targets: to provide improved
performances in terms of spatial resolution, so to be applied for example
in cracking/fractures status assessment.
The other possible activity will regards the information/knowledge
exchange between GPR technologists and practitioners and the partners
more involved in other sensing techniques, as EM induction, ERT,
infrared cameras, Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) multispectral
imaging, and with analysis techniques for material characterization and
identification. This interaction will be very useful to develop operative
protocols and data correlation/synergy to achieve effective integration
strategies in operative conditions. In this frame, it could be convenient
to define a catalog of the anomalies of interest and to build for each type
of element of the catalog the possible measurement strategy to be used.
Finally, it would be interesting to focus on the development of strategies
for advanced rendering and visualization modalities and augmented
reality so to improve the discovery and the fruition of nonaccessible/excavated heritage.

Abstract
Project 4.2 of COST Action TU1208 addresses a challenging and emerging field
of application of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), namely the localization of
people buried or trapped, possibly exploiting the detection of the Doppler
frequency changes induced by their physiological movements (i.e., heart-beat,
breathing). This paper outlines the main motivations for which the topic is worth
to be considered in the framework of the COST Action and provides an overview
of some relevant literature. Moreover, a first plan of the Project’s activities is
sketched, together with a discussion of which are some of the expected Project’s
outcomes.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The detection of buried or trapped human beings is an important issue
that is typical of disaster post-event scenarios, such as earthquakes,
collapsed buildings in consequence of anthropogenic disasters,
avalanches and so on. In such a framework, technologies deployed to
supply the operations of rescue squads can play a crucial role. As a
matter of fact, disaster survivors that are trapped under rubbles or
snow need to be saved in a very short time. For instance, victims buried
under collapsed buildings must be usually rescued within the first 72
hours, depending upon the type of entrapment, the pulverization of
debris and climatic conditions. In case of avalanches, this time interval
is dramatically reduced, since the probability of survival decreases to
90, 40 and 30 per cent, if the victim is removed from the snow within
15, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. For these reasons, detection
165

165

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

technologies must comply with the requirement of locating trapped
subjects with precision and quickly. Moreover, some victims can be
unconscious and motionless and their localization can be very
complicated. In these cases, the actual possibility of rescuing them can
only rely on the capability of detecting their vital signs, like breathing
and heartbeat. Obviously, this is a difficult task given the harsh and
hostile environment typical of post-disaster scenarios.
The above outlined conditions and operational requirements
naturally suggest the exploitation of the non-invasive capabilities of
acoustic and electromagnetic waves. For instance, a technology solution
of this kind is based on the use of a network of geophones [1], which are
quite simple to use and are indeed already adopted in surveillance
tasks, like detection of clandestine immigrants concealed in truck
trailers. However, these devices aim at an on-off detection, and do not
provide a precise localization of the victims. Moreover, their use requires
a quiet working environment, which is obviously not the case in rescue
operations at disaster sites.
Other technologies, based on radio-wave propagation, rely on the
fact that avalanche victims often wear electronic equipment
transceivers, such as Beacon or Appareil de Recherche de Victimes en
Avalanche (ARVA). Therefore, detection methods can exploit suitable
algorithms and interrogating signals to cooperatively interact with these
(known) radiating sources. More in general, the same principle inspires
other technologies aimed at detecting personal electronic devices
possibly carried by the victims [2]. However, in both cases, it cannot be
guaranteed that these devices are located next to a buried subject, nor
that trapped persons are indeed wearing them. Moreover, this is
certainly not a reliable assumption for people buried under debris.
With respect to the above framework, GPR systems appear as a valid
and viable option to tackle the problem of detecting conscious or
unconscious buried victims, as long as radio-wave penetration is not
hindered by layers of reinforced concrete slabs or structures mainly
made of metallic materials that, as well known, dramatically reduce the
effectiveness of the method, due to the arising of multiple reflections
and the lowering of the penetration depth.
Project 4.2 of COST Action TU1208 is hence focused on the
applications of GPR for locating buried or trapped victims, possibly
relying on the detection of their vital signs, and aims at supporting joint
research advancements as well as fostering industrial applications and
fall-outs.
In the following, we provide a brief overview of some relevant
literature, which can be helpful to trigger the discussion among the
COST participants, focusing their attention on some of the existing
technologies and implemented solutions. Then, we outline a first plan of
the Project’s activities, together with a discussion of which are some of
the expected outcomes of considering such a topic within a COST
framework.

II. AN OVERVIEW OF SOME RELEVANT LITERATURE
To provide a brief overview of some relevant results available in the open
literature concerned with the project’s topic, it is convenient to split the
applicative environment into two subcases. The first one is related to
the detection of buried victims “seen” as classic targets of GPR surveys,
that is as a perturbation of the backscattered signal due to dielectric
discontinuity represented by the human body with respect to the
surrounding environment. The second case is instead focused on the
detection via GPR measurements of vital signs characterizing the
trapped victim, such as heartbeat or breathing, which induce a low
frequency perturbation of the backscattered radar signal.
The first scenario occurs in the search for avalanche victims and is
the one that has been more broadly addressed in the literature. This is
due to the fact that deployment of GPR in the cryosphere has been since
long object of interest, thanks to the quite good penetration of
microwaves in snow. In this case, the contrast existing between the
human body and the snow characterizing an avalanche allows for the
adoption of “standard” GPR processing methodologies [3]. On the other
hand, a crucial requirement in this framework, as mentioned in the
introduction, is the need of keeping the time of the intervention as low
as possible, in order to allow saving the victim’s life.
In this specific case, the problem is hence that of surveying in the
shortest time as possible the avalanche area, by the relying on the fact
that avalanche snow is a quite favorable medium for radio-wave
penetration and that the body of the buried person reacts as a “strong”
scattering target hosted within an almost homogeneous medium. For
these reasons, the technological solutions typically rely on standard
UHF GPR systems (operating in the 0.4-2 GHz band) mounted on an
airborne platform (e.g. a helicopter or an unmanned aerial vehicle) or on
a moving tower, so to scan the area of interest in the shortest time
possible. Then, the need of very fast processing tools (in order to provide
almost real-time results) suggests the adoption of automated image
processing tools directly acting on the radargram and aiming at
extracting the possible victim’s signature from the raw signal.
Some interesting studies in this respect have been proposed by
Heilig et al. [4] and Fruehauf et al. [5] where an IDS RIS system,
equipped with properly designed processing tools, has been
experimentally tested. Also, the experimental test carried out by IDS in
cooperation
with
other
subjects
(www.idscorporation.com/en/georadar/more-information/
casestudies?task=document.download&id=88) using a 400-MHz antenna
mounted on an helicopter is worth to mentioned as an example of the
industrial interest on this topic.
The second scenario, which is representative of rescue and search of
victims buried or trapped under debris or snow, is a less conventional
one, as it is indeed claims for GPR systems and processing tools that
167

Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

are different from the ones routinely adopted in GPR surveys. On the
other hand, resorting to these different approaches is necessary for
several reasons.
First of all, the very inhomogeneous nature of the medium in which
survivors are trapped makes it impossible to exploit the retrieval of the
dielectric contrast features as the only means for detection, unless
sophisticated model-based processing tools are exploited. However,
these latter require some modeling assumptions on the surrounding
medium, which is indeed difficult owing to its aforementioned complex
nature. In addition, in the case of debris, traditional linear scans cannot
be performed, thus making further difficult the correct localization of
the possibly detected target on the GPR image.
To overcome this difficulty, the idea that has been pursued in the
last years by several researchers is to exploit the capability of radars to
monitoring breathing or heartbeat [6]. As a matter of fact, since from
the ’70 of the last century, studies in the field of biomedical engineering
have proposed and demonstrated the possibility of using radars to
extract vital signs. The underlying physical principle is the specific
Doppler signature associated with physiological processes such as
heartbeat and breathing, which results in a measurable frequency shift
induced in the reflected signal. Accordingly, when an unmodulated
radiofrequency signal is transmitted towards the human body, the chest
movements (due to heartbeat and breathing) modulate the phase of
reflected signal, which can be then demodulated by the radar receiver to
finally extract the vital signs’ signal components.
Owing to their simplicity of implementation, continuous-wave (CW)
radars, typically operating in the Instrumental Scientific Medical (ISM)
band around 2.4 GHz (which has the additional advantage of does not
needing a specific license), have been first considered for both people
buried under debris [7] and snow [8].
In CW-radars for survivors’ detection, a monochromatic wave is
transmitted in medium in the direction of investigation and the reflected
signal is used to provide information on the possible presence of a living
body, by appraising the Doppler frequency shift resulting from
breathing and heartbeat. However, a CW-radar assumes that the
subject is within beam of its antenna and cannot give any information
about the distance where the subject is located. Moreover, if different
targets to be detected are simultaneously present, this measurement
system needs multiple antenna CW radars and more sophisticated
digital signal–processing. In addition, in practical applications, this kind
of radars shows null detection points and co-frequency interference. To
overcome these problems many demodulation methods have been
developed and different architectures have been proposed.
A work which is interesting in this respect is the pioneering one by
Chen et al. [7], in which the possibility of detecting vital signs through
several layers of debris has been demonstrated using two CW systems
working at 450 and 1150 MHz, respectively, and finding that the higher
168

168

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

frequency one is better suited for the purpose. Also, the work by
Pieraccini et al. [8] is an interesting one, since it shows for the first time
the possibility of detecting both heartbeat and breathing through snow
layers, using a CW radar working at 2.4 GHz. In particular, an I/Q
receiver is exploited to avoid also null points, together with a simple
clutter removal least square minimization procedure.
As usual in radar technologies, some of the limitations of CW
systems can be overcome by resorting to frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radars and ultra wide-band (UWB) pulse
radars. As compared to CW radars, FMCW ones allow to measuring the
distance of the detected subject: pulse radars transmit a sequence of
short RF pulses, and evaluate the range position of the target by
measuring the time delay of the returning pulses. In more recent
systems, an UWB electromagnetic wave source generates short pulses
that spread their energy over a broad frequency range. These UWB
systems then employ the difference of the time-of-arrival of the
backreflected wave due to the movement of the chest of the person to
extract the desired features. One of the interesting features of UWB
radars is the enhanced capabilities they offer for clutter cancelation,
which have been for instance exploited by Zaikov and Sachs [9] to
design a prototype UWB radar, in which signal to clutter separation is
also pursued via principal component analysis. The same authors
recently performed a thorough analysis of the different sources of noise
faced in UWB detection of buried victims, and developed a model for a
pseudo-random radar which is similar to GPS, tri-lateration included
[10]. Loschonsky et al. have exploited different signal processing
algorithms based on windowed Fourier Transform and Continuous
Wavelet Transform [2] to extract the sought signature. More recently, Li
et al. have proposed the use of a processing chain made out of several
blocks (curvelet transform, singular value decomposition and HilbertHuang transform) to remove the direct wave, reduce noise and extract
the sought features [11].
As an alternative to monostatic or bistatic UWB radars, the use of a
moving UWB array to detect breathing has been proposed and
experimentally validated by Akiyama et al. [12]. Whereas, the work by
Grazzini et al. [13] is interesting due to proposed adoption of a Stepped
Frequency CW radar (SFCW) as a solution to overcome the poor time
stability of UWB impulse radar, which due to the jitter effect in the
pulse triggering process. This solution improves the overall capability of
detecting low frequency movements, also thanks to the enhancement in
the dynamic range allowed by this class of radars.
Recently, some of these concepts have been exploited by the
Sensor&Software “Rescue Radar” GPR system [14], which has been
tested in 2012 at a facility provided by the Ontario Provincial Police.
Interestingly, besides confirming the capability of GPR as a potential
tool for survivors’ detection, the experiment pointed some open issues
which have to be accounted for in tackling this topic, such as:
169

169

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

 the increase of sensitivity improves the probability of detection, but
also results in the occurrence of a larger number of false alarms;
 clambering over debris is more time consuming than performing
data acquisition itself;
 moving objects (or rubble) located in the vicinity of the sensor
appear to be the main source of false alarms;
 radio sources and cell phones (unavoidably present in the operative
scenario) create an interference that has to be accounted for by
some kind of integrated background noise monitor in order not to
impair the GPR survey;
 although difficult (see above), performing the measurement over a
regular grid seems to enhance detection probability.
In addition to the above points, some others are certainly worth of
consideration within the activities of the Project. A first one is related to
the different Doppler nature of the considered vital signs. As a matter of
fact, since a larger portion of the body is involved in breathing, the
Doppler radar cross section associated with this latter movement is
usually greater than that of heartbeat induced movements. As such, it
is quite likely that vital signs associated to heartbeat can be appraised
only in relatively simple situations (such as a subject buried under
snow), but cannot provide a useful signature to detect victims trapped
under debris. In addition, it is interesting to recall that the development
of GPR techniques for buried or trapped victims detection can take
advantage and mutuate results achieved in other applications. In
particular, an attention should be given to bioradiolocalization, wherein
vital signs monitoring capabilities of radars are exploited for biomedical
purposes, as well as through the wall (TTW) radars, where the aim is to
detecting moving or static targets and human beings hidden behind an
obstacle. As a matter of fact, in these applications, the same principles
and methods as the ones herein considered are exploited and similar
issues are faced. However, it has to be kept in mind that working
conditions of TTW radars typically operating in the ISM band are in
some sense simpler (the wall is homogenous, or reliably approximated
as homogeneous, whereas a collapsed building creates stratified slabs
of heavy rubble at different inclinations). Whereas, bioradiolocalization
systems operating in absence of obstacles between the sensor and the
examinee, can exploit higher frequencies (such as the Ka-band, 27-40
GHz, or the X-band, 10 GHz) than those actually useful to detect vital
signs of buried or trapped people (typically the ISM band around 2.4
GHz). As an example, TTW applications aimed at detecting the vital
signs of a subject behind a wall through micro-Doppler shifts are worth
to be considered. For instance, the self-injection-locked (SIL) method
proposed by Wang et al. [15], in which the signal partially reflected from
a distant target is injected in the same oscillator that produced the
transmitted wave, is an interesting solution. As a matter of fact, this
170

170

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

technique improves the sensitivity of demodulation and allows the radar
system to achieving higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). By so doing, the
TTW radar sensor can monitor tiny body movements of subjects that
stay still, e.g., seated persons, while at the same time efficiently
detecting the position of individuals concealed behind the wall.

III. CONCLUSION: A FIRST WORKPLAN FOR FUTURE ACTIVITIES
The motivations outlined in the introduction and the necessarily brief
overview of some recent achievements in the field of GPR for detecting
buried or trapped people are meant as a starting point for the
discussion among the COST’s participants about the possible
contributions that can be provided by our COST actions. In this respect,
we feel that a first important step to pursue would be to establish an
open database of the relevant literature that can be accessed, compiled
and modified by all the project’s participants. This would allow to
creating, in a cooperative, unbiased, fashion a useful resource for the
academic and non-academic community that is interested in this topic.
In addition, the evolution of this open database could provide a tool to
re-directing the project activities along the lines emerging from a
constantly updated and accurate observation of the stare of the art. As
a second point, the need of interfacing the academic efforts with the
already existing industrial activities is an important mission for a
Project carried out in a COST framework. To this end, it can be foreseen
that in future workshops of COST TU1208, specific focus sessions (with
standard and/or interactive presentations, or based on a round-table
scheme) will be organized gathering together different expertise and
experiences, so to foster cooperation. Hopefully, this should allow
manufacturers to becoming aware of recent academic advancements
and academic people to focus their efforts to the challenges poses by the
on-field applications. In this perspective, the involvement of
representatives of Governmental agencies in charge of search and
rescue operation is another important aspect.

Abstract
Preservation and maintenance of transport infrastructure is a global concern
that affects social and economic development in all countries. During the last
decades, there has been a continuous increase in the use of non-destructive
testing (NDT) applied to many aspects related to civil engineering field. Ground
Penetrating Radar (GPR) has become an established method of inspection. This
paper presents a compilation of works in the frame of the COST Action TU-1208,
showing the most of the applications of GPR and other NDT methods concerning
the topic of the Project 4.3. Published works in roads and pavements, concrete
and masonry structures, and tunnel testing, the participants of the Project
participated on, are mentioned. It has been demonstrated that such methods
have significantly benefited the procedures for inspection and also, successfully
solved some of the limitations of traditional methods.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The deterioration and distress mechanisms that are active under the
surface cannot be assessed by traditional visual and optical inspection.
Alternative methods are therefore required for inspection. GPR has been
established as one of the most recommended NDT methods for routine
sub-surface inspections.
The use of GPR in civil engineering applications began to appear in
the mid-1970s and the 1980s. Some of its main applications include
services such as pavements, utilities and voids detection, as well as
different structures associated with the transport infrastructure, such
as bridge decks, retaining walls, masonry structures and tunnel
inspections [1].
In the next Section, “Applications of GPR”, some of the published
works has been compiled to show the potential of the method.
A brief review regarding the use of other NDT methods was also
included.

II. APPLICATIONS OF GPR
This Section is divided into four sub-sections regarding the main types
of structures in the transport infrastructure:
Roads and Pavements
The pavement life-cycle is not only affected by the number of heavy
loads but also layer thickness is a vital factor defining the quality of
pavements. Deficiencies in thickness reduce their lives, and periodical
rehabilitation is therefore necessary in any country’s road management
program to maintain roads in optimal conditions of use or monitor
quality control. Road inspections imply the evaluation of different
parameters such as roughness of the pavement, skid resistance, and
presence and condition of cracks, voids and delamination.
GPR technology is rapid, cost effective, and allows field surveys to be
conducted without disturbing the pavement structure and the normal
traffic flow [2], [3]. GPR has been successfully used to find voids and
cracks under pavement [4]–[6] as well as to monitor quality control on
new asphalt overlays or to evaluate base course quality [7]. But above
all, measuring pavement layer thickness is one of the most known
applications of GPR [8]–[12].
There are complementary NDT technologies to the measuring of
different road characteristics. Some examples are mobile LiDAR for
geometric measurements and laser profilers for the evaluation of the
pavement surface roughness (International Roughness Index - IRI). In
[13], a novel method consisting of mobile LiDAR technology is presented
to evaluate layer thicknesses and volumes for newly constructed
pavements. The method was favourably validated by GPR. Additional
geophysics is also commonly applied in combination with GPR.
Reference [14] applies infrared thermography for the detection of
pavement cracks or moisture content. The structural evaluation
(bearing capacity and layer stability) is quantitatively evaluated with the
Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) [15] that measures the
deformations of the pavement in response to heavy loads. Reference [16]
presents a case study of premature cracking where combination of GPR
with FWD methods and laboratory measurements allowed the
identification of severe water content as the reason for cracking.
Reference [17] deals with the comparison of pavement layer moduli
calculated from FWD deflection data using layer thickness obtained by
GPR and coring. Furthermore, this paper concluded that there is a
tendency in reinforcement projects to apply recycling methods and use
recycled materials so, knowing the continuous thickness of asphalt
layers by GPR is essential in order to determine the optimum thickness
available for milling and thus achieve optimization of recycling process.
In addition to road/highway pavements, this sub-section includes
airport runways and railroad ballast. Delamination, cracks and voids
174

174

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

are the most common diseases in airport runway, which are particularly
more severe due to the higher traffic loads that pavements are
supporting. GPR is commonly combined with the Heavy Weigh
Deflectometer (HWD) for airfield pavements inspection.
GPR also provides noteworthy information of the ballast quality and
the track bed condition [18], in addition to the geotechnical properties
or subgrade and subsoil materials [19]. Reference [20] combines
different geophysical techniques (3D GPR, Electrical, and microgravity)
to analyse the stability of railways, which allowed the determination of
deformation of the layering of the railway, and other anomalies such as
voids.
Concrete Structures
Concrete structures are also included in the diagnosis of transport
infrastructure such as bridge decks and retaining walls along roads and
railway lines, as well as over/underpasses to ensure the passage of
wildlife animals, person and agricultural machinery. The diagnosis of
concrete includes: estimation of thicknesses, location of reinforcing bars
and metallic ducts, estimation of bar size, location of voids, effects of
water, chloride content and delamination or cracking.
GPR has proven to be a suitable NDT method for the inspection of
concrete structures as demonstrated by several publications within the
past decades [21]. Detecting water content is an important phase for the
diagnosis of concrete. Reference [22] observed a linear relation between
the velocity of propagation of the direct wave and moisture. In addition,
GPR can be successfully used for the location of salt ingress due to the
influence of chloride content on the permittivity of the concrete [23].
What is more, [24] shows its capabilities to analyse the corrosion of
reinforcing induced by chloride content.
In other published works, the method enables inspectors to obtain
information about reinforcing bars, defining depth of rebar, and location
of tendon-ducts on bridge decks [25]. The reflection coefficient of a thin
layer into concrete was evaluated in [26] in order to estimate the
detection limit of the GPR antenna. The reflection coefficient revealed to
be linearly dependent on the thickness-on-wavelength ratio for
thicknesses less than λ/11. Other NDT measurements (such as
electrical, sonic, seismic and infrared thermography) combined with
GPR have earned the interest of researchers on the assessment of water
content and alkalini-aggregate reaction on concrete, as well as concrete
quality and delamination [27], [28]. Reference [29] presents a
combination of GPR, capacitive and impact-echo measurements to
analyse porosity and water and chloride contents. Other possibility
which is currently promoted is combination of GPR with laser scanning
that provides exact information about the surface of roads and
structures, and their suburb in combination to GPR data of the subsurface [30].

Mansory Structures
The most of the masonry bridges are the oldest structures still in use in
the transport infrastructure. These constructions are subjected to
special tension conditions because of the increase in traffic loads and
ageing, which produce material degradation and structural damage.
Some of the most typical damages in masonry bridges are: moisture,
differential settlements, and thermal deformation with subsequent
bulging of spandrels, damages in wing walls, cracking, as well as arch
mechanism failure and loss of ashlar.
During the last few decades, GPR has been demonstrated its
capabilities for bridge inspection. Reference [31] successfully applied
GPR for assessing masonry bridges, which determined the effectiveness
of the method in obtaining relevant structural information concerning
the presence of cavities and faults, and reinforcement elements, in
addition to ring stone thickness and foundation conditions.
Other studies employed GPR together with other NDT methods for
more exhaustive evaluation of stability. Reference [32] have shown the
joint effectiveness of GPR, infrared thermography, and sonic methods
for obtaining unknown geometric data and finding hidden
characteristics such as voids, moisture content, and inhomogeneous
filling.
In addition to geophysical inspection, other NDT optical methods
were also for appropriate combination. The metric information obtained
by photogrammetry or laser scanning allows for the characterization of
the stonework and filling, which provides better understanding of the
GPR propagation phenomena. This combined approach can be also
used to define a hypothesis for structural analysis, which describes
structural behaviour of the structure or structural stability of arches
[33]. Masonry structures are built using heterogeneous filling that often
complicates the interpretation and analysis of field GPR data. FDTD
modelling of the GPR signal is therefore typically used as additional
interpretational tool. Some authors [34] have employed novel FDTD
numerical modelling sub-gridding scheme to simulate GPR responses
from delamination or ring separation in brick masonry arch bridges, in
which different aspects were considered such as, the effect of varying
the thickness of faults, their location, and the effect of water ingress in
hairline delamination on GPR signals. More sophisticated and realistic
modelling can be obtained when a combination of different NDT, such
as infrared thermography and GPR, is considered to create models [35].
Tunnels
GPR has proved a valuable method for tunnel quality management and
detection. There are successful works in detecting thicknesses of both
lining and backfill grouting layers behind the concrete lining [36], as
well as to identify defects in lining such as voids and cracks [37].
176

176

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

Additional information can be obtained to define rebar geometry,
including corrosion detection. Variations in water content, and other
aspects, as the presence of reinforcement elements embedded in lining
[38], can be also obtained by GPR.
Integration of different geophysical methods was also considered for
evaluating tunnel stability. There is published works which integrate
GPR with seismic method in order to provide additional mechanical
characteristics of the damage in addition to elastics characteristics of
discontinuities in order to examine possible areas of instability [39].
Other advanced NTD optical methods, such as 3D laser scanning, have
shown also their capabilities to be integrated with GPR [40]. Such
technology allows for the detection of defects on tunnel surface such as
water exudation, which could be directly related with inner faults
detected by GPR.

III. CONCLUSION
Although GPR have demonstrated its capabilities for roads and
transport infrastructure inspection, alone or in combination with other
NDT, further research is required in developing more cost-effective
acquisition methodologies and processing.
The presence of defects in pavements, as well as concrete and
masonry structures is difficult to detect using standard procedures.
Combined approaches by considering different NDT methods are needed
because there are many different aspects influencing the detection of
such defects. For example, improvements were recommended by several
authors to detect and characterize cracking. The existence of cracking
can be related to local variations in the amplitude value registered when
collecting data over the crack. However, it seems difficult to quantify the
defect as many previously unknown aspects are influencing this
amplitude value such as crack filling, crack aperture, crack height, and
crack angle. An interesting combination could be GPR and infrared
thermography, since this complementary technique has shown its
capabilities for determining the depth of cracks due to the temperature
difference between the unaffected area and the depth (in pixels) of the
crack. Infrared thermography is also useful in combination with GPR to
map shallower moisture content, in addition to the use of LiDAR or even
multispectral cameras that delimit moist areas from the intensity
attribute.
Further development is also demanded concerning to affordable
systems for road/highways inspection, as well as to use in airport
runways and railways diagnosis. The tendency is to integrate
complementary sensors such as LiDAR, RGB cameras, profilometer or
video camera, thermography, and GPR, all mounted in a moving vehicle
and spatially related to a common trajectory defined by global position
systems (GPS/GLONASS) aided with inertial measurement unit (IMU)
177

Examples of recent automatic systems that combine some of related
sensors are Road Doctor (Roadscanner), SITEGI (Uvigo), and SITECO.
The large amount of data collected when surveying relevant
infrastructure makes difficult to process all the data and manage in a
reasonable amount of time. More powerful and versatile processing
tools are therefore demanded to optimize time and resources invested.

Abstract
Geophysics is the study of the earth’s interior, using measurements based on
physics principles. A part of this, geophysics is also used to explore the interior
of construction materials of buildings and Monuments. The major advantage of
this science is its absolute non-destructive character. However, despite
geophysics exist since the beginning of the 19th century the Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) method is recently introduced in this domain, counting almost 50
years of active contribution. During these years, GPR was proved very effective
in the building assessment. In the field of geotechnical tasks and especially in
geological tasks, its efficiency was limited and strongly dependent on the site
conditions, mostly due to its limited in-depth penetration and relative target
discrimination. Future research must be oriented to the improvement of these
two major milestones, mostly into the antennas design and related instruments
electronics design.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The GPR method was invented during the Vietnam War from the
Americans, as a tool to locate the mines below the ground surface. Even
today, the method is still used for the same purpose, apart from all the
other areas of application. The principle of GPR is to send with an
emitter antenna, very short electromagnetic pulses through the ground
or the structure. Those pulses propagate towards all directions (or in
the half-space downward only, if the antenna is shielded) and are
reflected when they meet interfaces between media of different
electromagnetic properties. A receiver antenna measures the amplitude
of the signal over time (Fig. 1). On the resulting scan, both the direct
183

wave and the waves reflected on the different interface scan are
observed. This method allows detecting voids, layers interfaces, humid
zones and material modifications. In reality, the GPR method is closely
related with the classic seismic reflection method. The difference in
these methods is the type of wave used to travel in the media. In the
case of the seismic reflection method, the wave is a brief acoustic pulse
where in the case of GPR it is an electromagnetic pulse (Dirac). Based
on the above concept, the applications of GPR extend from the
allocation of small cracks into the concrete or the stone, up to the deep
mapping of lake bottoms, or even glaciers thickness of several hundreds
of meters.

II. THE GPR IN CONCRETE AND BUILDINGS EVALUATION
The reinforced concrete (RC) is the modern building material in our
world today and its degradation with time, the corrosion of its
reinforcing bars creates conditions that require a periodic control of its
critical properties. For this reason, assessing concrete properties and
durability indicators (strength, porosity, moisture content, etc.) using
NDT methods can play an important role in the process of RC
structures management before any expensive maintenance is
undertaken. However, the main problem is the limitation of only one
NDT technique to evaluate one concrete property. For instance, GPR
technology is sensitive to water saturation but also slightly sensitive to
porosity [1], ultrasound is able to evaluate the modulus of elasticity but
it is also sensitive to moisture and density, and so on. For these
reasons, some researchers have proposed combining several techniques
for concrete strength evaluation or for detection and visualization in
concrete structures, or the combination of several NDT parameters
obtained with the same technique [2] in an attempt to confirm the
diagnosis or to reduce the measurement noise. This original approach,
which consists in combining NDT data, is promising but only if the
additional cost is balanced by an enhancement of the diagnosis quality.
In the context of concrete evaluation of existing structures as building,
GPR can be used as a complementary method for the rapid evaluation
of moisture which could lead to correction of the effect of moisture on
seismic methods. The term “seismic” includes all methods based on
acoustic pulses, ranging from ultrasonic to subsonic spectra, i.e.,
ambient vibrations, Impact-echo and down to seismic refraction
tomography
profiling).
Seismic
data
provide
valuable
and
complementary information like dynamics modulus and vibration
modes, highly related to damages and structural solutions. Masonry
structures are also frequently evaluated by means of GPR in
combination with other techniques, as i.e., in historical buildings. In
this case, non-destructive analysis is a helpful process to assess their
conditions. Notwithstanding, some problems appear in the case of these
184

184

TUD COST Action TU1208

special constructions: the high variability of the materials and
structural elements (frequently poorly documented) and their irregular
surfaces. Recently, the question of detection limits of commercial
antennas was studied. It is proved that for layers thinner than λ/11(for
an error inferior to 10 %), the reflection coefficient still depends linearly
on the thickness to wavelength ratio [3]. It is also proved that layers
with a thickness inferior to λ/100 (about 1.3 mm here) could be visible
with GPR. By this method, the amplitude reflected by a thin layer can
be estimated. The layer will then be visible if this reflected amplitude,
after subtraction of the losses (including the intrinsic and geometric
attenuations), is superior to the signal noise.

III. THE GPR IN THE GEOTECHNICAL SECTOR
In the geotechnical sector and a part of road infrastructures
assessment, GPR is used mostly in foundation studies and sometimes
in cuts & retaining structures studies for the assessment of the
geometry of the shallow geological layers. During the last years, GPR
was frequently used in studies of wind generators foundations. Usually,
these constructions are installed at very high altitudes, top of mountain
areas, where the rock is strongly weathered and very often hides large
cavities or entire caves. The depth of investigation must be in the range
of 7-8 m and GPR becomes a good method for a fast subsurface 3D
mapping. A significant constraint is always the superficial “skin” layer
that in many times is presented as a very conductive clay layer. In these
cases, GPR cannot be applied and the use of electrical 2D profiling is
inevitable. In almost all cases of wind generators foundations, a skin
layer exists, either as one clay layer, or as one thin gravel layer. The
gravel layer imposes problems in GPR application on site, mostly from
the irregular scattering of the pulse into the gravel voids. This problem
can be avoided by using lower antenna frequencies but this reduces the
target resolution. Other applications in the geotechnical sector include
mapping of utilities or unknown infrastructures like pipe networks,
hidden reservoirs and other. Due to low depth of these features, the
GPR can be used alone, although is advised to be used with another
geophysical method in a parallel sense to reduce uncertainty. A typical
example is shown in the (Fig. 2), where the existence of one old
subsurface drainage system below an ancient prehistoric grave (Tholos
Acharnon, Greece) was identified with GPR and mapped with accuracy
with 2D electrical imaging. However, the major problem of GPR is also
noticed here. Is it obvious that features with high resistivity (hot red
areas: drainage system) are easily mapped with GPR (see at the offsets
of 0 to 8 m of the electrical profile). In contrary, a thin low resistivity
layer (see at the offset of 15 to 18 m – thin blue region with resistivity
down to 15 Ohm*m) makes almost invisible the second feature
(rectangular tank) in the GPR corresponding section. Other applications
185

185

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

are related to subsurface imaging below the foundations of Monuments.
Damages in these structures could be due to foundations problems or
shallow geological features. Usually antennas from 400 to 100 MHz are
utilized. Seismic methods use to be the most applied as complementary
survey, and in shallow profiles, seismic shear-wave velocity layering
correlates well with GPR layers interfaces. In many cases resistivity
methods could provide also layers stratification to correlate with GPR
interfaces. An example is shown in (Fig. 3), where results from the study
of the ground under the Cathedral of Mallorca [4] are presented. Two
different geological zones produce different images in GPR diagrams and
in resistivity images, being also different the seismic wave velocities
associated to the layers in both areas. It is usual to combine
geophysical methods to different techniques or evaluations, like finite
elements models or other, photogrammetry, laser scanning or other
optic or topographic measurements. In Greece, GPR method is widely
applied in geotechnical issues regarding ancient monuments. In the
retaining wall of the sanctuary of Oropos, the GPR method was used for
the assessment of the soil as well as the construction details of the wall
[5]. The width of the wall has been defined, using a 800 MHz antenna,
providing valuable information for the geometry and therefore the load
bearing capacity of the structure.

IV. THE GPR IN GEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
In the area of geological applications, the classic geophysical methods
like seismic refraction and electrical resistivity profiling dominate today
in the private sector services. In addition to these methods, Low
Frequency Electromagnetics (VLF) in combination with very old
geophysical practices like the Spontaneous Potential method, or Microgravimetry fill the modern services palette of today’s modern
geophysical services providers. The GPR method is not widely used
today in the geological services sector. This is mostly due to two major
disadvantages of the GPR, the penetration depth and the difficulty of
application on true site conditions. An additional disadvantage of GPR,
in relation to other geophysical prospecting methods is the inability to
penetrate into the water saturated zone. The groundwater level presents
for GPR an absolute reflector of all the transmitted energy so there is no
possibility to map any kind of geological or anthropogenic features
below the groundwater level.
In general, GPR is considered a valuable method for shallow
geophysical investigations, as archaeology, where all targets are covered
from a shallow earth skin layer and the resistivity contrast between the
environment (usually sediments) and the building material (usually
rocks) is high. In this case, GPR is very effective but still as long as the
site and soil conditions permit the application of the method. In a wide
number of cases, GPR is used as supporting survey, being other
186

186

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

geophysical methods the main exploration procedure. Perhaps the
exception is in archaeological sites first evaluations, where 3D GPR
imaging provides valuable information about the shapes and structures
existing in the site, and use to be applied as main study before
excavations. Working with GPR to support other geophysical methods in
exploration geology means to operate at frequencies of 100 MHz and
below, up to 25 MHz. Using antennas in these frequencies, penetration
depth can reach sometimes to 40 m in very resistive formations like
limestone or granite. In these cases it is possible to map with accuracy
the fault zones and shallow strata with one outstanding resolution, as
long as there is no earth skin cover to attenuate the signal. Fault
mapping is one critical geological application in the initial phase of
tunnel design works and assessment. It is evident that faults affect
strongly the tunnels construction and especially when a significant
overburden exists, a fault may induce inflows into the tunnel front,
slowing down the entire project and imposing a significant increase in
construction costs to stabilize the front. In this specific case, the GPR
method when applied in low frequency antennas can be very helpful.
Significant correlation of GPR (at 25 MHz range) with Very Low
Frequency Electromagnetics (VLF) has been proven. This is due to the
fact that the fault zones identified from very low frequency EM currents
are wide enough in space (20 – 30 m fractured zones) to be allocated
with these antenna wavelengths. In addition, due to their high
resistivity contrast with the hosting environment (high resistive rocks)
together with their irregular geometry and step inclination, these zones
are easily identified with GPR. The Rough Terrain Concept antenna of
MALA GEOSCIENCE at 25 MHz frequency performs very well in these
application areas. In resistive environments, the 250 MHz ground
coupled antennas can reach depths of 6–7 m maximum, being still in
the range of some geological – geotechnical applications such as the
mapping of cavities, fractures or voids. In this sector, the GPR is used in
a complementary sense with the geophysical 2D resistivity imaging
method. In fact, the depth of penetration of 6 m is enriched from the
resistivity profiling and the accuracy on the discontinuities of rock is
enriched from the GPR profiling. This complementary use of these two
different methods has been proved very effective on site and provides
accurate results. In tunneling assessment during the construction
phase, GPR survey is also possible, mainly using borehole antennas in
the tunnel front when potential faults and cracks could exist. However,
in many cases, non-directional antennas are used in borehole
applications. In this case, the main difficulty is to define the azimuth of
the different targets, and three or more boreholes are needed in order to
place accurately the anomaly. Notwithstanding, faults and non-stable
areas could be well defined. Borehole GPR is also applied to study
buildings foundations before tunneling in dense areas (e.g., in cities)
where constructions are poorly documented. Detection of paleochannels and streams is other possible GPR application, used for
187

187

TUD COST Action TU1208
Civil Engineering Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar

different studies. Microzonation is used to define soil predominant
period values, usually associated to extended areas. GPR could be a
useful tool to determine shallow geological features and to define
different ground areas, previously to the vibration measures. These
zones could be determined by the existence of paleochannels or streams
in quaternary materials, because soil seismic response change due to
the presence of these geological structures.
Plus and Cons of GPR in geological applications
A part of the penetration problem, the field irregular topography
imposes always a problem in the application of GPR, especially with the
ground coupled antennas. This is a serious application problem
because even with a topography correction the ground roughness
induces a very high noise level in the data. Clearing the paths prior to
measurements is impossible for geological applications. With the RTA
25 MHz unshielded antenna, MALA has done one important step toward
this direction. However, unshielded antennas are not the best tool when
operating outwards due to the high amount of unwanted surface
reflections (trees, buildings etc). The need for a new type of antenna
strongly exists in these areas. This antenna must be of an air coupled
type, shielded in order to send all the energy downwards and in low
frequency ranges, to be able to penetrate enough into the subsurface.
The first requirement (air coupled type) is the most important for
geological applications, due to the fact that an air coupled antenna will
be easily carried above the ground with a constant motion or
alternatively with a mechanism, avoids also the vegetation or other
obstacles.

VI. CONCLUSION
Major milestones for the GPR method in geological and geotechnical
sectors remain the penetration depth that is seriously lower to other
geophysical methods and the easiness of the application of the method
in the rough field conditions. Although the problem of penetration is
unsolvable so far as it depends on the signal energy, efforts must be
oriented to increase the penetration of the signal. Air coupled antennas
in the low frequency range are also a promising orientation but so far,
only a few are present in the active market. Another issue is the
improvement of the borehole GPR antennas especially in positioning
and especially in azimuth. Horizontal Directional Drilling technologies
are very elaborated in these fields and possibly a combination with the
these technologies (beacons) could solve the position problem. In the
buildings assessment in contrary, the GPR method is much more

elaborated and marketed especially from his fastness and easiness on
site. This is a promising sector, taking into account that parallel
methods are elaborated in the same time, like for example the multispectral image analysis of concrete [6] and other.

The scientific activities of the COST Action TU1208 are carried out within four WGs.
The effectiveness of this scheme will be checked after the first year of activities and will
eventually be modified, considering the actual number of active participants in each
WG and the number of new participants that join the Action.
The structure of each WG will always be kept as flexible as possible, in order to enable
other participants to join the Action. All the participants, when joining the Action, are
invited to provide basic information on their experience, interests, and current research
projects. They are also invited to provide WGs and Projects preference. Each participant
can belong to two WGs; within each WG, each participant may join an arbitrary number
of projects.
The four WGs of the COST Action TU1208 are:
WG1 – Novel GPR instrumentation
WG2 – GPR surveying of pavements, bridges, tunnels and buildings; underground
utility and void sensing
WG3 – EM methods for near-field scattering problems by buried structures; data
processing techniques
WG4 – Different applications of GPR and other NDT technologies in CE
Each WG is managed by a Chair and a Vice Chair.
The WG meetings constitute an opportunity to present activities, results and plans for
the future. Between meetings, the WG members regularly interact.

Rome,	  
22nd	  –	  24th	  July	  2013	  
	  
The	  
	   COST	   Action	   TU1208	   focuses	   on	   the	   exchange	   of	   scientific-­‐technical	   knowledge	   and	   experience	   of	  
Ground	   Penetrating	   Radar	   (GPR)	   techniques	   in	   Civil	   Engineering	   (CE).	   The	   project	   is	   being	   developed	  
within	   the	   frame	   of	   a	   unique	   approach	   based	   on	   the	   integrated	   contribution	   of	   University	   researchers,	  
software	   developers,	   geophysics	   experts,	   Non-­‐Destructive	   Testing	   equipment	   designers	   and	   producers,	  
end	   users	   from	   private	   companies	   and	   public	   agencies.	   In	   this	   interdisciplinary	   Action,	   advantages	   and	  
limitations	  of	   GPR	   will	  be	   highlighted	   leading	   to	   the	  identification	  of	  gaps	   in	  knowledge	  and	  technology.	  
Protocols	  and	  guidelines	  for	  EU	  Standards	  will	  be	  developed,	  for	  effective	  application	  of	  GPR	  in	  CE.	  A	  novel	  
GPR	   will	   be	   designed	   and	   realized:	   a	   multi-­‐static	   system,	   with	   dedicated	   software	   and	   calibration	  
procedures,	   able	   to	   construct	   real-­‐time	   lane	   3D	   high	   resolution	   images	   of	   investigated	   areas.	   Advanced	  
electromagnetic-­‐scattering	   and	   data-­‐processing	   techniques	   will	   be	   developed.	   The	   understanding	   of	  
relationships	  between	  geophysical	  parameters	  and	  CE	  needs	  will	  be	  improved.	  Freeware	  software	  will	  be	  
released,	  for	  inspection	  and	  monitoring	  of	  structures	  and	  infrastructures,	  buried-­‐object	  localization,	  shape	  
reconstruction	   and	   estimation	   of	   useful	   parameters.	   A	   high	   level	   training	   program	   will	   be	   organized.	  
Mobility	   of	  early	  career	  researchers	  will	   be	  encouraged.	  The	  project	   has	  already	  received	  the	  interest	  of	  
key	  end	  users	  and	  excellent	  EU	  Institutions.
