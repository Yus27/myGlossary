GROUND		PENETRATING		RADAR			 	  	 	  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  PREFACE We are very pleased to present the first issue of the first peerreviewed scientific journal devoted to Ground Penetrating Radar. This new journal stems from the COST (European COoperation in Science and Technology) Action COST Action TU1208 “Civil engineering applications of Ground Penetrating Radar” and the present issue comprises a series of papers where results of ShortTerm Scientific Missions carried out in the framework of the Action are presented. Short-Term Scientific Missions aim at supporting individual mobility of European researchers, strengthening networks and fostering new collaborations. They allow scientists to visit an institution or laboratory in a Country participating to a COST Action. A STSM shall specifically contribute to the scientific objectives of the Action offering the grant, at the same time allowing the visiting scientist to learn new techniques or gain access to specific instruments and/or methods not available in his/her own institution. Standard STSMs may have a minimum duration of 5 days and a maximum duration of 180 days.

INTRODUCTION Railways, as all infrastructures, have to behave properly during their life cycle. A regular maintenance policy has to be established, to guarantee high safety standards (Sussmann et al. 2001). At the same time, costs and traffic interruptions have to be limited. Nowadays, track monitoring mainly consists in measuring parameters related to the track layout and rail wearing. During maintenance operations, some track components have to be replaced while others can remain the same, as for example the substructure (Esveld 2001; Berggren 2009). This monitoring procedure does not detect the real causes of rail deficiency, which may be due to the presence of ballast pockets, fouled ballast, poor drainage, subgrade settlements or transitions problems (Manacorda et al. 2002; Fontul et al. 2011; Hyslip et al. 2012). A more in-depth analysis of the conditions of both the railway platform and substructure is crucial to reduce maintenance costs and increase operational safety levels. Non-destructive testing techniques can be effectively employed for railway assessment. The main purpose of this Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM) was to study how Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can be used to inspect infra-and superstructure in railways. In particular, the assessment tasks addressed in this work are: detection of track defects at  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  2  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  infrastructure level, measurement of layer thickness and evaluation of fouling level of ballast. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM Different GPR systems were used and compared, in terms of their capability to detect defects in the subgrade (at platform level), as well as to estimate the dielectric permittivity of concrete asphalt for sub-ballast. The accuracy of different inspection procedures was evaluated (through calibration by metal plate and drill cores), in order to determine which is the best way to proceed when carrying out such GPR measurements. Three different tasks were considered: 1. Evaluation of the ground condition: detection of voids and cracking. 2. Infrastructure inspection: measurement of pavement thickness. 3. Superstructure inspection: evaluation of ballast condition. 2.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE USED GPR SYSTEMS All measurements were carried out by using a ground-coupled system by Malå Geoscience (brought to Lisbon from the University of Vigo, Spain) and an air-coupled system by GSSI (available at LNEC, Portugal). The main characteristics of both systems are reported in Table I. 2.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST SITE AND SPECIMENS 2.2.1 Task 1. Evaluation of the ground condition The experimental activities were carried out in the test site shown in Figure 1, at LNEC. Metal plates located in the subgrade were very useful for data interpretation and for the calibration of the aircoupled antenna (see the schemes reported in Figure 2). The soil employed to realise the road base is classified by the Unified Soil Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  3  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Classification System as clay of low plasticity, or lean clay. In the gradation test, 66% of such material passes the No. 200 sieve. The Atterberg limits are: plastic limit 19.9% and liquid limit 46.5%, which lead to a plasticity index of 26.6.

Infrastructure inspection The experimental activities were carried out in the test site shown in Figure 3, at LNEC. Three different railway substructures are present in this test pit structure. They were suitably modified to serve the purposes of this study. In particular, the test site is divided into two sections: one of them has a square area of 4.0 × 4.0 m2 and a depth of 2.80 m, with concrete floor and walls (concrete pit section); the other section is rectangular with a 4.0 × 6.0 m2 area and 2.60 m depth. In order to ensure a homogeneous subgrade, the existing materials were excavated and replaced with new ones. As shown in Figure 4, three different infrastructure solutions were implemented (Cells 2 to 4), where various nonconventional railway substructures using asphalt sub-ballast were constructed instead of conventional structures using granular subballast.

Superstructure inspection Different conditions of ballast were simulated to study how they affect the measured GPR signal: • Data measured on new ballast were compared to data measured on old or used ballast. • The influence of fouling conditions was investigated. • The influence of water content was studied. Firstly, two specimens were built and the dielectric constants were estimated for both new and used (old) ballast (see Figure 5). The material was compacted with a VIBRO-VERKEN system by applying a weigh of 57 Kg with 2850 pulses/min for a total of 2 min. To calibrate the dielectric constants of ballast material, each box has two points with controlled height (see Table II). Moreover, aluminium foil was introduced at the bottom of the boxes to reflect the signal in order to facilitate the thickness measurement.	  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  7  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  FIG. 5 − Boxes containing new (left) and used (right) ballast.  Next, two boxes (3 and 4) were built to study the influence of (1) fouling and (2) water content in the dielectric constant value. New ballast was included in box 3 and used ballast in box 4. To simulate fouling, a layer of soil with high level of clays was merged every two consecutive layers of ballast (see Figure 6).

The total height of the specimen resulted in average 18 cm. The specimen built to simulate 15% of fouling (box 4) was composed of: 1 layer of ballast + 3 kg of soil + 1 layer of ballast + 3 kg of soil + 1 layer of ballast + 3 kg of soil + 1 layer of ballast + 3 kg of soil + 1 layer of ballast. The total height of the specimen also resulted in average 18 cm. These two specimens were then compacted as boxes 1 and 2 and the final configuration is described in Table II.  Fig. 6 − Distribution of soil between two consecutive layers of ballast.  The initial water content of the soil was measured. A sample of soil was dried during a day at 104º, which resulted in 5.5% of	 water content. The wet and dried weights of the sample were 245.38 g and 231.76 g, respectively. Different water contents were then considered: as described in Table III, different quantities of Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  9  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  water were scattered in the boxes 3 and 4 (see Figure 7) to reach water content levels of 10 and 14%. The purpose of these tests was to simultaneously study the effect of the fouling and water content. Better results can be obtained by using larger boxes.

TASK 1. EVALUATION OF THE GROUND CONDITION For the ground-coupled system, data were acquired with a traceinterval of 0.01 s. Marks were taken when collecting data, to subsequently correlate them with those measured by the aircoupled system. For the air-coupled antennas, the data acquisition was carried out by distance, with a trace-interval of 1.0 cm. Additionally, Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) Figure 8-left) was used to evaluate the bearing capacity of the subgrade. The thicknesses obtained from GPR data were combined with deflections measures with FWD, to produce the structural models of the subgrade layers. For a given thickness, the deflection values is higher if the elastic moduli of the subgrade is lower, which could be interpreted as an anomalous zone and can be due to cracking, interlayer debonding or construction failures. LFWD measures Figure 8-right) were also performed, to add more information and validate the interpretation of the damaged areas identified by GPR and FWD. Finally, in order to corroborate the joint interpretation of GPR-FWD-LFWD, drill cores Figure 9 were extracted in the detected damaged areas. 3.2. Task 2. Infrastructure inspection The purpose of these tests was to analyse the accuracy of the GPR systems used in this STSM for thickness measurement. Different GPR systems Figure 10 and antenna configuration were employed Table I. Different methodologies for data acquisition were considered to characterize the asphalt (first bituminous layer in Figure 4. A ground-coupled system was used, with central frequencies 1.0 and 2.3 GHz. During data acquisition, antennas were moved along the surface line and data were acquired in both static and dynamic modes. An air-coupled system was used, with central frequencies 1.0 and 1.8 GHz, and with antennas suspected at about 45-50 cm. Also in this case, data were acquired in both static and dynamic Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  11  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  modes.

For each system, two different GPR lines were acquired by distance in all the cells Figure 4. The static data were gathered at two control points assigned in each profile line. After surveying, drill cores were extracted through  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  13  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the bituminous layer at these control points to proceed with calibration see Table V.

Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  14  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Two different methodologies were employed to calibrate the velocity of propagation and to measure thicknesses, as described in the following. 1) Coring. For both ground-and air-coupled antennas. Knowing the thickness of the layers (d) from coring and the travel time difference (twt) to and from the target, the velocity of propagation can be derived from Equation (1). Next, the dielectric constant values can be obtained from Equation (2).  𝑑=𝑣  𝜀=  !"!  (1)  !  ! !  (2)  !  where 𝑐 is the free-space velocity (0.3 m/ns).

For air-coupled antennas. By knowing the amplitudes at the interfaces and travel-time distances (twt) between reflections, it is possible to estimate the layer dielectric constants and thicknesses. The first step in the process is determining the dielectric constants for each layer. The amplitude of the incident GPR signal and the amplitudes of the layer returns are necessary for the calculations, see Equation (3). In particular, the amplitude of the incident GPR signal is determined by collecting data over a large flat metal plate placed on the pavement surface. Because metal is a good conductor, it can be considered as a perfect reflector.  𝜀! =  ! ! !! ! !! ! !! ! !!  (3)  This is the dielectric constant of the first layer; in the formula, A1 is the amplitude of the reflection from the surface; Am is the amplitude of the reflection from a large metal plate. Next, the amplitude profiles are transformed into layer thickness profiles as follows:  𝑑=  ! !"! !  (4)  where the distance travelled by the radar-wave (𝑑) is coincident with the thickness of the layer, 𝑐 is the speed of light, twt is the two-way travel-time distance between two different reflectors (layers), and 𝜀 is the dielectric constant obtained by Equation 3. 3.3. TASK 3. SUPERSTRUCTURE INSPECTION Static measurements were carried out at the control points assigned in specimens Table II. Data was acquired using both ground-and air-coupled systems with a trace-interval of 0.01 s. The data acquisition with the ground-coupled system was conducted with the antennas in contact with the ballast, without elevation; while the air-coupled antennas were suspected with an elevation about 40 cm Table I.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM 4.1. TASK 1. EVALUATION OF THE GROUND CONDITION In the following radargrams, in red rectangles are the metal plates and in yellow circles are the possible damaged areas. A) Location 1: through the middle of the test site Figure 2) The comparison of the 1.0 GHz data obtained with both groundand air-coupled antennas Figures 12 and 13, respectively) demonstrate that the ground-coupled system provided more resolution in imaging, which allows for a better definition of anomalous zones. Moreover, the 2.3 GHz data Figure 15a displayed even better resolution than 1.0 GHz data Figure 12.  Fig. 12 − 1.0 GHz data obtained with the ground-coupled system.  Additional FWD measurements were carried out coinciding with the reflection profiles acquired through the middle of the experimental area. In Figure 15b, it can be observed that places representing more noise correspond to FWD results with anomalous deflections. For example, at positions 1.5 and 7.5 m, there is a difference in deflection trend namely D3 that is higher Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  17  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  than D2. In almost all the points, see position 9.0 m, there is a bit difference between D0 and D1. The anomalies presented above can be due to cracking on the soil top layer (9.0 m) or even in layer beneath (1.5 and 7.5 m) or to debonding. The only two positions that present better continuity of the deflections are 0.0 and 12.0 m. This means that the load transmission is better so the continuity of the layer is better (or lower cracking). Comparing FWD data with 2.3 GHz data in Figure 15a, it was corroborated the good agreement between the methods when identifying both anomalous deflections and reflections.The anomaly identified at 7.5 m was also detected in the 1.0 GHz data produced by the air-coupled system Figure 13. This interpretation is more detailled in the graphics reported in Figure 16.  Fig. 13 − 1.0 GHz data obtained with the air-coupled system.  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  18  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  LFWD measures were performed to add more information in order to validate the interpretation of the damaged areas achieved from GPR and FWD methods.  Fig. 14 − 1.8 GHz data obtained with the air-coupled system.  Fig. 15 − a) 2.3 GHz data obtained with the ground-coupled system, and b) deflections produced by FWD (yellow squares indicate where drill cores were extracted). Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  19  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Figure 17 presents the LFWD data produced through the middle of the test site, which corroborates the existence of anomalies or damaged zones at 1.5, 7.5 and 9.0-10.5 positions. To corroborate the joint interpretation of the GPR data and both FWD and LFWD data, coring was performed in those areas showing the most apparent anomalies (7.5, 9.0 and 10.5). In addition, a drill core was extracted in a position where non-anomalous were detected (12.0 m). The positions of such cores are illustrated as yellow squares in Figure 15b. Figure 18 displays the drill cores extracted. The core extracted at 7.5 m presents severe cracking in the subgrade, while the one extracted at 9.0 m shows defects between layers (delamination). The anomalies detected at positions 1.5, 7.5, 9.0 and 10.5 m have also presented certain continuity in some of the GPR data provided in Figures 20-25.

Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  20  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Through these experiments, it was demonstrated that groundcoupled systems have clear advantages compared to air-coupled systems: they provide both better signal penetration and vertical resolution to detect fine details as cracking.

TASK 2. INFRASTRUCTURE INSPECTION: PAVEMENT THICKNESSES 4.2.1. Bituminous thicknesses obtained by using the coring method Tables VI and VII show the dielectric constants and velocities obtained from the coring method for the first or bituminous layer in Figure 4. For both ground- and air-coupled systems, these values were obtained from Equations (1)-(2) and by using the static data acquired at each control point of the three different cells. Table VI describes the dielectric constants and velocities of propagation obtained for the ground-coupled system (frequencies of 1.0 and 2.3 GHz). The velocities obtained range from 0.121 m/ns to 0.137 m/ns, resulting in average values of 0.125 m/ns, 0.130 m/ns and 0.133 m/ns for Cells 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Table VII presents values obtained with the air-coupled antennas (frequencies of 1.0 and 1.8 GHz). For the GSSI system, the velocities obtained range from 0.112 m/ns to 0.130 m/ns and average velocity values for Cells 2, 3 and 4 of 0.117 m/ns, 0.124 m/ns and 0.12 m/ns, respectively. Comparing the dielectric constants obtained from both systems, it was observed that the ground-coupled system provided lower values than the air-coupled system.

SUPERSTRUCTURE INSPECTION Ballast fouling and moisture content are major issues in railway assessment usually leading to settlements of the railway. They can be easily evaluated by GPR as the dielectric value of the ballast increases with the presence of water (Sussman et al. 2012). This change is particularly relevant on contaminated ballast as the fine soil particles are more susceptible to the increase of water content of the material due to the decrease of drainage capabilities (De Chiara et al. 2014). Some laboratory tests were developed in this STSM to evaluate the dielectric constants for different levels of fouled ballast (0, 7.5 and 15%). The effect of water content in dielectric constant was also evaluated, and different water contents were considered: 5.5, 10 and 14%. For evaluation, two different GPR systems, air- and ground-coupled antennas of different frequencies and from different companies, were assumed Table I. Firstly, the influence of the ballast condition on the dielectric constant was analysed. Table X displays the results obtained. Significant differences were not observed between the dielectric constants obtained for new (box 1) and used (box 2) ballast, showing the used ballast slightly higher values in comparison to the new material.

Different levels of water content were simulated: 5.5, 10 and 14%. As it was expected, the comparison of fouling ballast 0% Table X, 7.5% Table XI and 15% Table XII, with 5.5% of water content, has demonstrated that dielectric values increase with the increasing of fouling conditions. The dielectric constants also increase with the increasing of water content. However, the analysis of all the values obtained has revealed that values are more sensitive to the fouling level rather than with the water content. Thus, the increasing of fouling reflected in a major dielectric constant variation. Different tendencies were found between the different equipment used, and the dielectric constants obtained with a frequency of 1.0 GHz were slightly lower than those obtained with higher frequencies of 1.8 GHz and 2.3 GHz. This behaviour was observed for both air- and ground-coupled antennas. Similar differences were found in Fortunato (2005) between frequencies of 500 MHz and 900 MHz. Additionally, the dielectric constants obtained for all the increasing fouling conditions and water contents, with a central frequency of 1.0 GHz, were also different between equipment. The results obtained with the Malå Geoscience system were slightly lower than those obtained with the GSSI system. Although a similar behaviour was observed in Task 2, when estimating asphalt thicknesses (Subsection 4.2.1), the difference could be also caused by a certain influence of limited dimensions of the boxes (0.65 m long, 0.2 m high and 0.4 m wide). The transmitted signal could be affected by boundary conditions, even more when the antenna was suspended (air-coupled antennas). 5. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION This scientific collaboration between the University of Vigo and the LNEC has been very useful not only for the visiting and host scientists but also for the PhD Student Vânia Marecos, Member of COST Action TU1208 from LNEC.

INTRODUCTION The mission aimed at performing GPR and passive seismic measures in interesting sites in Malta. The used radar system was a prototypal stepped-frequency reconfigurable GPR. The original system was recently implemented by IBAM-CNR together with the University of Florence and IDS Ingegneria dei Sistemi within the research project AITECH (www.aitechnet.com/ibam.html). During a previous STSM carried out in 2014, the prototype was brought to Norway and carefully compared with commercial systems manufactured by 3d-radar. Based on the results collected during that mission, the prototype was improved. The mission in Malta represented an opportunity to test on real scenarios the improved version of the prototype. Moreover, during this STSM, GPR measurements were performed for the first time in Malta. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM In the period 13th-23th July Dr. Raffaele Persico, researcher of the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage IBAM-CNR performed some geophysical measurement campaigns in Malta together with Dr. Sebastiano D’Amico, researcher of the University of Malta, within the short term scientific mission STMS “Use of GPR and standard geophysical methods to explore the subsurface”, supported by the European Cost Action TU1208 “Civil Engineering Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  34  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Applications of Ground Penetrating Radar”. The exploited techniques were Ground Penetrtating Radar (GPR) and passive seismic, mainly using single station-location measurements. The elaboration of the GPR data has been then performed with the help of Dr. Loredana Matera, fellow researcher at IBAM-CNR. The purpose of the measures has been twofold, namely to test the performances of an innovative GPR system (Persico and Prisco, 2008), recently upgraded thanks to the results collected during a previous STSM, and to perform GPR and passive seismic analyses in several sites of interest in Malta, in order to get an insight about the geological conditions in some sites of interest and about the internal status of some historical monuments. In particular, GPR and passive seismic analyses have been performed also in the cocathedral of St John, patrimony of UNESCO, with the aim to test the displacement of some tombs under the floor and investigate the cause of a fracture evident on one of the headstones. We decided to perform some analysis in this test site (even if the site was not listed in the work plan submitted before the STSM) because of its importance. The prototypal stepped frequency reconfigurable GPR contains three equivalent couples of antennas with the same gap, achieved from two series of switches along the arms. The on and off state of the switches make equivalently longer or shorter the antennas, so to achieve efficient transmission on three bands that cover the comprehensive frequency range from 50 MHz to 1 GHz. Accordingly, now on we will distinguish a low frequency antenna (central frequency about equal to 120 MHz) from a medium frequency antenna (central frequency about equal to 250 MHz) and a high frequency antenna (central frequency about equal to 500 MHz) (Persico et al., 2014). The system can gather data with all the three equivalent antennas within each going through, so that we achieve three B-scans for each measurement line. This can be useful because, as well known, there is a trade-off between the available resolution of the images (which is achieved with higher frequencies) and the penetration depth of the radiation, which is usually achieved with lower frequencies. However, the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  35  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  conditions of the soil are not known a-priori all the times, neither the depth of the targets of interest, so that the large quantity of gathered data provides some robustness against these uncertainties. The same purpose might be reached also with a system equipped with three separated couples of antennas. However, such a system would be necessarily larger and more weighting than a system where the three couples of antennas are, let say, coincident. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no commercial systems with three pairs of antennas exist, but only systems with two pairs of antennas at most. On the other hand, the large amount of gathered data prevents (at the moment) the visualization of the data in real time. As a future development, possibly, a more efficient acquisition software (e.g. based on the C language rather on the current MATLAB code) joined with a more powerful laptop (e.g. equipped with a parallel processor) will allow to overcome this drawback. Another feature of the reconfigurable system is the possibility to program the integration time of the radiated and received harmonic signals. This option can be useful in order to counteract narrow band interferences in an efficient way. In particular, commercial stepped frequency systems allow, at most, to set the amplitude of the integration times of all the radiated and received harmonic tones. This means that, if interference is recognized, we can counteract it only prolonging the integration times of all the harmonic tones, which is redundant and above all prolongs meaningfully the time required for gathering the data. Instead, thanks to the reconfigurable system, we have set and tested a method for recognizing, in the field, the most disturbed tones (if any), and have set an algorithm that increases the integration times accordingly to the recorded disturbance, tone by tone. This allows to safe time and prevents from the measure becoming too long and expensive. The algorithm for the choice of the reconfiguration times works as follows: as a first step, a preliminary B-scan is performed, possibly coinciding with the first B-scan of interest for the GPR Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  36  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  prospecting at hand. For each trace of this B-scan, and for each harmonic tone within the trace, N samples of the in phase and inquadrature (I and Q) components are retrieved and stored, and the variance of the I and Q samples is calculated as 𝝈𝟐𝑰;𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉 = 𝑬 𝑰𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉  𝟐  𝝈𝟐𝑸;𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉 = 𝑬 𝑸𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉  𝟐  − 𝑬 𝑰𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉  𝟐  − 𝑬 𝑸𝒇𝒌, 𝒕𝒉  𝟐  (1)  where E is meant as the algebraic average of the samples. Then, the variance 𝜎!!!, !! of each tone for each trace is retrieved as the ! ! algebraic average of 𝜎!;! and 𝜎!;! . Then, conservatively, as an !, !! !, !! index of the degree of disturbance at each frequency, we keep the maximum of the variance for each tone and each trace the quantity 𝜎!!! = 𝑚𝑎𝑥! (𝜎!!!, !! ), namely the maximum variance over the traces for each tone, which is a function of the frequency. After, visualizing the graph of 𝜎!! vs. the frequency, we can decide whether a reconfiguration of the integration time of each tone is needed or not. At this point, if we decide to apply a reconfiguration, we have just to set an integer number M>1, that quantifies the maximum “degree” of reconfiguration needed in the case at hand. Then, the reconfiguration code calculates a factor of enlargement for each integration time according to the low: 𝐹 𝑘 = 𝐶!"# 𝑀  !!!! !"#! !!!!  (2)  where F is the factor of enlargement for the kth tone. The function Ceil stands for the minimum integer not smaller than the argument. In other words, an enlargement times a factor Ceil is calculated for the most disturbed tone, while the other ones are about proportionally less enlarged with the implicit care that the reconfiguration will never shorten the default integration, which is guaranteed by the Ceil function. Indeed, the hardware of the system does not allows an enlargement of the default integration Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  37  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  time beyond a factor equal to 10, and therefore a subsequent “ifthen” instruction saturates to 10 any value F >10. This because the hardware of the GPR system can prolong at most 10 times the default integration time of each harmonic tone. Let us explicitly note that the chosen algorithm is not semantically equivalent to impose that F is minor or equal to 10. Some passive seismic techniques where used in order to gather useful data to be compared and integrated with those obtained with the GPR. Ambient noise was recorded using a three-component seismometer TrominoTM (www.tromino.eu). The Tromino is a compact, lightweight and self-contained instrument, and its ease of use makes it ideal to perform a large number of measurements in rugged terrain that are accessible only on foot. Time-series of 20 min each were recorded at a sampling rate of 128 Hz and, following the guidelines suggested by the SESAME project (Bard, 2005) these were divided into 60 nonoverlapping time windows, each of which of 20 s. The Fourier spectrum of each window was computed and smoothed, and after ‘cleaning’ the traces from spurious noise event windows, the resulting H/V, in the frequency domain, was derived using the geometric mean of the spectral ratio obtained for each time window. The use of the H/V method was first proposed by Nogoshi & Igarashi (1971) for the estimate of seismic site response. Nakamura (1989) eventually made this method widely popular as a cost-effective and reliable means of predicting the resonance frequency of a site, particularly when low shear-wave velocity layers present a sharp impedance contrast with the bedrock. The presence of a resonance peak in the H/V ratio has been interpreted both in terms of SH-wave resonance in soft surface layers, or in terms of the ellipticity of particle motion when the ambient noise wave train is made up predominantly of surface waves (Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. 2006). In practice, the wavefield is expected to be a combination of both types, and the H/V curve contains information about the shear wave velocity profile in shallow sediments. In the following, we will describe the results Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  38  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  achieved in several sites in Malta Figure 1. As a further premix, we accounted, as far as possible, of the geology of the Malta. The geology of the Maltese islands is well known (see Pedley et al., 1976, 2002 and references therein) and consists of four main sedimentary layers but the relief, which is largely controlled by the neotectonic pattern, is rather complex. The Maltese islands are made up of a sedimentary sequence deposited during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs.  Fig. 1 – Location sites were GPR and passive seismic measurements have been taken during the STSM  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  39  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  There are four main strata, reflecting abrupt changes in the depositional environment during this period Figure 2. Starting from the oldest one, the sequence consists of: (i) the Lower Coralline Limestone (LCL) formation (Chattian): This is the oldest unit of rock visible above sea level. It is a hard and compact pale grey limestone, rich in coralline algae, and can be over 140 m thick. The LCL forms the sheer cliffs bordering the south-western coast of the Maltese islands. (ii) the Globigerina Limestone (GL) formation (Aquitanian– Langhian): This layer is made up of soft yellowish fine grained limestone. Its thickness varies between 20 and 200 m.  Fig. 2 – (a) The geological stratification of the Maltese islands including the members, sublayers, geological era, texture and outcrop occurrence of all the layers. The colour code is followed in subsequent figures Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  40  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  (modified from The Geological Map of the Maltese Islands (Oil Exploration Directorate, Office of the Prime Minister, Malta, 1993)); (b) outcrop geology of Malta and Gozo (Oil Exploration Directorate, Office of the Prime Minister, Malta, 1993) with topography and major fault patterns (Mapping Unit, Malta Environment and Planning Authority, MEPA, 2010). The figure taken from Vella et al., 2013  The fine-grained GL is lightly cemented making this layer soft and easily cut, sculpted and eroded. It is subdivided into three sublayers: the Lower (Mlg), the Middle (Mmg) and the Upper Globigerina Limestone (Mug). These three layers are separated by two thin hard ground conglomerate layers (Mc1/Mc2), which are much harder and more resistant to erosion, and easily identified when exposed. (iii) The Blue Clay (BC) formation (Serravallian to early Tortonian, denoted as Mbc): This layer can be considered as a continuation of the Globigerina Limestone being composed of very fine grained sediment and containing deep water planktonic organisms. The main difference is the higher clay mineral content which gives this layer the banded bluish grey colour. The mix of clay between the lime rich sedimentary grains prevent the binding of the particles hence it is the softest layer of all and is eroded very quickly with rain water. Very often it provokes landslides and in various parts of the islands it forms 45° talus slopes over the underlying strata. Its depth varies between 70 and 20 m, thinning notably from west to east of the archipelago (Pedley et al., 1976). Above the Blue Clay Formation is a thin layer of bioclastic limestones named the Greensand Formation (Mgg). This layer varies from 1 to 11 m in depth and is present only in a limited number of areas of the islands. (iv) the Upper Coralline Limestone (UCL) formation (late Tortonian–early Messinian): this is the uppermost, and youngest layer and was formed in very similar conditions to the Lower Coralline Limestone, in shallow waters. This hard pale grey layer can reach thicknesses of more than 160 m in certain parts of the islands. As with the LCL, the layer presents a variety of facies Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  41  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  ranging from reef limestones to cross-bedded sands and finegrained muds. No marine sediments younger than the UCL are found on the islands, indicating that the time of uplift of the islands above sea level together with the northern flank of the Sicily Channel Rift (Pedley et al., 2002) occurred around 6 Ma ago. This uplift coincided with the closure and partial desiccation of the Mediterranean during the Messinian. Some patchy deposits of the Pleistocene epoch containing remains of terrestrial fauna were laid down on land by fluvial action and are mostly found near shorelines and in caves. Over approximately the eastern half of the island of Malta, the BC and UCL layers are absent, the GL being the outcropping layer. The western half of Malta, together with the island of Gozo, on the other hand, conserve the whole sedimentary sequence and are largely surfaced by UCL at a relatively high elevation, underlain by the BC layer, except for eroded topographical features. In this study we also used the ambient noise measurements to investigate the dynamic characteristics of features at different stages of the destabilization process affecting the cliff area on the Maltese islands. In fact, the archipelago has several areas of coastal instability characterized by active lateral spreading, rock sliding and rockfalls, which happens to be situated in an area of coastal land use in the form of amusement parks (Galea et al., 2014), urban areas (Panzera et al., 2012a) as well as cultural heritage sites, and which therefore has solicited further concern. In the northern part of the island of Malta, as well as in Gozo, the geomorphology is mostly dictated by the fact that the UCL forms a rigid rock slab resting on a much weaker layer of clayey material. This geological situation creates stresses in the upper slab resulting in fracturing and brittle collapse (Gigli et al. 2012). When the exposure of the geological cross-section is along the coast, the additional weathering effect of marine processes accelerates the destabilization by erosion of the clay layer. This results in the formation of large cliff-parallel surface fractures, that produce partially isolated blocks having volumes of the order of thousands of cubic metres. Horizontal and vertical mass movement of such Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  42  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  blocks forming part of the cliff face, and boulder detachment and collapse, result in a fractured and boulder-strewn coastline, that is typical of much of the northwest coast of Malta. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM 3.1. MEASUREMENTS CLOSE TO THE GOLDEN BAY, MALTA We have performed a first set of measurements in the “Golden Bay” area in the vicinity of “G ajn Tuffie a Tower”. The tower is part of the fortification structures built by the knights of St. John. In particular it belongs to the “Lascari towers” between 1637 and 1652 and commissioned by the Italian knight Giovanni Paolo Lascaris who was Grand Master of the Order. The area is affected by the presence of later spreading and the retreating of the cliff edge due to the fracturing of the Upper Coralline overlaying the Blue Clay as previously explained. The prospected rectangle is approximately indicated on the Google map in Fig. 3. This area was chosen because the presence of large fractures in the nearby region. Figure 3 also shows the location of the single-station measurements and where H/V results were obtained, where Figure 4 shows the results achieved from the passive seismic measures. In particular, notable characteristics may be identified for each area. The first important observation is the presence of an ubiquitous resonance peak at between 1.0 and 2.0 Hz and a dip in the spectral ratio below 1.0 over a wide frequency range. This is not surprising because previous ambient noise studies have repeatedly confirmed that all areas of the Maltese islands where UCL outcrops is underlain by a layer of Blue Clay and exhibits a peak in the H/V of this consistent frequency (Panzera et al. 2012, 2013; Vella et al. 2013). Di Giacomo et al. (2005) and Castellaro & Mulargia (2009) interpret the dip in the H/V ratio in terms of a shallow shear-wave velocity inversion, which in this case corresponds to the interface between the UCL and BC. The interpretation of other features of this peak in terms of Rayleigh wave ellipticity and/or trapping of SH waves in the lowPublisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  43  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  velocity layer is the subject of an ongoing study using numerical modelling. Moving from the inland area towards the cliff edge and rock sliding area, the nature of the H/V response changes strikingly. On the plateau away from the cliff edge, the site response shows only the simple and consistent peak at around 1.5 Hz as described above, while the rest of the H/V amplitudes remain at a level well below 2.0 (top left graph panel). Moreover, it is observed that at higher frequency of the spectrum there are peaks not observed on the plateau area that may be tentatively associated with mechanical vibration modes of the whole blocks. The area investigated using the GPR can be approximated to a rectangle of size about 5.2x6.5 square meters Figure 3, and has been prospected with Bscans parallel to each other, directed toward the sea and spaced 40 cm from each other.  Fig. 3 – The Golden Bay. The prospected area is approximately indicated by the rectangle. The arrows indicate two point where the soil is collapsed. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  44  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  The Bscans end in proximity of the cliff, about 30 meters high, sharply overhanging the sea. On the top of the cliff, some naturally opened holes witness the possibility of the presence of deep fractures in the cliff, which might one day lead to some collapse. Two of these subsidence points are indicated with the arrows in Figure 3, and as can be seen they are quite aligned to each other. In Figure 5 horizontal slices achieved at different time depth levels are reported, showing that the subsidence have a deep track. In this case, the low frequency equivalent antennas have been exploited, because the anomalies of interest are quite extended and it was of interest to increase the penetration depth of the signal.  Fig. 4 – H/V curves obtained at the three different sites.  The processing has been minimal, including zero timing, gain vs. the depth, background removal, and slicing (Persico, 2014). No migration has been performed, being the anomalies quite large. The processing has been performed with the Reflexw commercial code (Sandmeier, 2003). From Figure 5, it can be appreciated that the two subsidence evidences (especially the lower one) continue along the depth, but at the moment they do not appear to be contacted to each other. However, they could be in a future if the phenomenon is progressive. Let us outline that the conversion time depth was done on the basis of the fact that the cliff is done of limestone and Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  45  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the soil was dry. Indeed, the Bscan did not show any meaningful hyperbola associable to a small target (Soldovieri et al., 2008; Mertens et al., 2015), so that the method of the diffraction hyperbolas would have been unreliable, neither we had at disposal separable antennas in order to perform a CMP measure. 3.2. MEASUREMENTS AT LAFERLA CROSS, MALTA After the case study of the Golden Bay, essentially founded on geological reasons, we have afforded a case history of interest partially for geological reasons and partly for engineering reasons (Masini et al., 2010).  Slice at shallow depth  Slice at 15 ns, about 85 cm  Slice at 30 ns, about 170 cm  Slice at 50 ns, about 280 cm  Fig. 5 – Time slices at different levels close to the Golden Bay site.  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  46  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  The church of Laferla is an abandoned church on the top of a small hill, near to a cross visible at distance. In Figure 6, Laferla church is the building on the central low part of the image. Indeed, there is a geological sliding in that area that has strongly damaged the church, that was closed because dangerous. However, the population of the area is attached to its old church and there are proposals of moving it away from its current position. So, it was of interest to perform a preventive investigation in order to check the situation of an area nearby the church. Indeed, it was not easy to perform a complete series of parallel Bscans, because of the irregular topography of the soil, and so we performed 6 Bscans as referenced in Figure 6. The processing was the same as that described for the Golden Bay, but the data have been migrated too because it was possible to evaluate the propagation velocity from the diffraction hyperbolas (it was about 12 cm/ns). It has to be said, however, that we did not have at disposal a GPS system, so that the position is qualitative, based on the sketch and on some distances taken by us in the field. In the following, we will discuss the results achieved for each Bscan. Due to the purposes of this prospecting, the data mostly of interest are those at medium frequency.In Figure 7, the processed Bscan 1 is shown. The Bscan was done parallel to one of the side walls of the church, which shows a big fracture in its central part. We have looked whether there was something buried that might be correlated to this fracture. The Bscan shows some anomaly, the most evident of which is at the abscissa 80 cm and between the time depth levels of 10 and 20 ns. However, we deem it ascribable to some boulder or to some ashlar (because it is a large but not strong reflector), and not related to the fracture. The results relative to Bscan n. 2 are shown in Figure 8. In Figure 8, we appreciate that the soil presents layered in the first 20 ns (about 120 cm) and above all there are at least three relevant discontinuities. The strongest one, between the abscissas 8-10 m is possibly related to a cavity with reinforced ceiling. In fact it is known that there is a cavity where the ceiling has been reinforced. Maybe, the floor produces the multiple flat reflections appreciable below that Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  47  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  anomaly. Another strong but localized anomaly is visible about at the abscissa 5 m. It might be associated to some boulder. Moreover, two further meaningful discontinuities can be appreciated under the first two meters of the scan and between the abscissas 16-18 meters. The second one of these discontinuities is quite meaningful and might be related to some further cavity, or to a part of the cavity visible at 8-10 m where the ceiling has not been reinforced.  Fig. 6 – La Ferla church and the Bscans performed about it.

Fig. 8 – Results relative to B-scan 2 in Fig. 6. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  49  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  There is also an anomaly, visible in the first meters, possibly connected to the B-scan 6 discussed in a while. The results of the B-scan 3 are reported for completeness in Figure 9, but they do not show any anomaly of interest but for a confirmation of some layering of the shallower part of the soil. The results of B-scan 4 (reported in Figure 10) show a large anomaly between the abscissas 2 and 6 m. This anomaly is probably related to the anomaly visible in the B-scan 2 at 16-18 m, and enforces the hypothesis of a buried cavity in that zone. A second anomaly between the abscissas 8 and 12 m is visible too in Figure 10. It seems to be the contact line between two zones with some different properties of the soil. It might be related to some work done in the past. The results of the B-scans 5 and 6 are reported in Figures 11 and 12, respectively. In the B-scan 5, we see a strong and large superficial anomaly between the abscissas 5.2 and 8 meters, whch we ascribe to the reinforced ceiling of a cavity under it. In particular, we deem that this strong anomaly in Figure 11 can be related to the strong superficial anomaly visible between 8 and 10 m under B-scan 2 Figure 8. Beyond this anomaly, a further meaningful reflection among the abscissas 10 and 12 m is still visible in Figure 11, possibly ascribable to a material of different consistency. Finally, in Figure 12 (B-scan 6) several anomalies are visible. However, we identify an obliquous descending trace in the first part and an oblique ascending part from about 6 and 8 meters. We know that in that area a collapse has happened in the past and has been then filled up again. We interpret the B-scan 6 in Figure 12 as a cut of the collapsed area. In particular, looking at the displacement of the Bscans and at the first 7.5 meters of the B-scan 2 Figure 8, we see some resemblance between the sort of filled tank that appears in the B-scan 6 and something similar in the B-scan 2, indicating possibly two different cuts of the same collapsed and subsequently filled up hole.

MEASUREMENTS IN THE MADLIENA TOWER, PEMBROKE, MALTA The Madliena tower is a mighty structure, exploited in the past as watchtowers between 1658 and 1659 with very thick walls since it was a military defensive tower. A photograph of the tower is shown in Figure 13. The inner of the tower at the ground floor in just a rectangle of 2.9x3.9 square meters, plus a small corridor toward the door. We have prospected this room, with interline step of 20 cm. We exploited also an option of the instrument, that allows optionally to assemble the manhole in a perfectly vertical position.  Fig. 11 – Results relative to Bscan 5 in Fig. 6  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  52  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Fig. 12 – Results relative to Bscan 6 in Fig. 6  In fact, in general the manhole of a GPR is slightly oblique, because in this way the human strength for pushing the instrument is dynamically better exploited.However, this is useful and in many cases indispensable when the prospecting is performed on the grass. Indoor, the mechanical resistance to the rotation of the wheels is customarily much lower, and vertical manhole in these cases allows to safe space and prospect a larger share of the room. In Figure 14 depth slices at different time depths are shown. The data have been gathered with the medium frequency antennas and the processing was the same as in the previous cases. The data are not migrated for lack of precise information about the propagation velocity. The GPR results suggest the presence of a foundation, with the walls prolonging (and possibly still enlarging toward the inner part) underground at least up to the depth of 1 m, but probably also beyond (the lack of a precise value of the propagation velocity of the waves prevents from more detailed evaluations. In fact, the main reflections are displaced all around the room toward the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  53  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  walls. This makes us think of foundation possibly excavated directly in the rock, as a trench. No particular anomalies beyond these ones have been identified. The tower has also been probed with a passive seismographic device, the results are summarised in Figure 15. In particular measurements were taken at the top level, at the middle level and also on the ground floor. The H/V curve taken on the ground floor confirms that the tower is located on solid rock and as seen in other studies the H/V curve gives a flat response (Panzera et al 2013; Vella et al. 2013). The very high-frequency peaks (between 100 and 200Hz) can be interpreted as a thin layer of soil as shown by the GPR. However, further investigations and numerical modelling are needed in order to confirm such hypothesis.  Fig. 13 – The Madliena tower at Pembroke, Malta  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  54  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Figure 15b shows the H/V obtained at the roof level. The fundamental frequency, which is the lowest frequency of the building, is clearly identified in this case for both the longitudinal direction at a frequency of about 6Hz. On the other hand, higher frequency modes were difficult to identify due to the fact that the structure is not very high. 3.4. MEASUREMENTS OUTSIDE BIRKIKARA, MALTA  THE  CHURCH  OF  SANTA MARIA,  Measurements have been gathered also outside the church of Santa Maria, an historical building where some structural problem had been previously identified. In particular, some fractures and some movements of part of the walls had been identified. GPR data were gathered with an interline space of 50 cm, the results shown here are relative to the medium frequency antennas. The processing was the same exploited in the other cases. For a geometrical quantification, the notch on the white lines corresponds to the length of 2 meters. The main results are shown in Figure 16, where slices at different time depth levels are shown. For a correct understanding of the results, please note that that the homogeneous orange area perfectly identifiable in the upper images corresponds to a part where the GPR could not pass. Indeed, it is an area where the wing of the church still extends, but we did not have at disposal a graphical tool that allowed us to find out the correct shape of the prospected area, and we could just superpose the result provided by the Reflexw software (that by default completes each slice with zero padding up to the smallest rectangle containing the data) to a google earth map of the area. That said, the data indicates a confused situation with respect to the shallowest levels, which have been somehow strongly reshuffled in the 20th century. However, beyond the time depth level of 10 ns some more isolated anomalies are visible.

The homogeneous orange areas are zones where the instrument could not pass.  Fig. 15 – Seismographic results in the Madliena tower. The top and bottom panels show the results obtained on the ground floor and at the roof level respectively (see text for details)  farthest from the wall of the church are at least partially ascribable to tombs, because it is known that there was a cemetery in that area. However, there are some clear anomalies also close to the walls of the church, outlined by the ellipsis superposed to the slice at 10 ns and by the circle superposed to the slice at 15 ns. They might be related to the structural problems that the building is having. Beyond the slices shown in Figure 16 three single B-scans have been gathered along the sidewalk that run around the church structure, in order to have some data very close to the building. The location of the B-scans is shown in Figure 17, whereas the results are shown in Figure 18.

Looking at Fig. 18, we identify that the under the line of Bscan 1 these is a quite clear discontinuity suggesting a two layered soil in the first part. The level of this interface oscillates slowly around 15 ns (about 75 cm). Moreover, several stronger reflections appear within this scenario, indicating maybe past works with heterogeneous materials used for the filling. In any case, the prospecting indicates markedly the most inhomogeneous conformation under the line of B-scan 1 among the three.

Both GPR and passive seismographic data were gathered in the co-cathedral. Results are presented in the next Section of the report.

MEASUREMENTS IN VALLETTA, MALTA  THE CO-CATHEDRAL OF  ST. JOHN, LA  Fig. 19 – Map of the prospecting performed in the co-cathedral of St. John Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  61  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Fig. 20 – time slices in the entrance chapel of the co-cathedral of St. John. For time depth conversion: the upper left slice is quite superficial (5-7 cm), 5 ns correspond to about 25 cm, 15 ns correspond to about 75 cm, 30 ns correspond to about 150 cm.  With regard to the GPR data, a small rectangle as evidenced in Fig. 19 has been prospected with interline spacing 40 cm, as well as three single B-scans in the main nave as evidenced still in Fig. 19. The data gathered on the rectangle in the lateral chapel (where nowadays there is the entrance for the tourists) where aimed to establish whether a crack on a gravestone on the floor was due to some void under it. In fact, the floor of the church is indeed a sequence of gravestones, but not all of them really correspond to an Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  62  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  underlying tomb. GPR data have been gathered on a small rectangle (2.4x3.1 square meters) about centred on the crack. This time, the high frequency antennas have been exploited, being the cause of the crack likely to be related to a possible cause buried in the first meter at most. The results are reported in Fig. 20, and show some superficial inhomogeneous features, but we do not identify any meaningful cavity. This suggests us that the causes of the crack must be superficial. On the other hand, when present, shallow cavities are usually well visible, as can be appreciated from the results achieved in the nave of the church. In particular, three B-scans as referenced in Fig. 19 have been gathered and processed. The results are provided in Fig. 21. In general, single B-scans are not sufficient to foresee the presence and the positioning of the tombs (horizontal slices are more well advised for that). However, due to the kind of site that we have prospected, in the case at hand the presence of tombs is possible where many multiple reflections are visible, and these are well identified in several points of the scans, and are particularly evident in the longitudinal B-scan n. 3, probably because this one crosses some tombs along their long side. 3.6. RECONFIGURATION OF THE INTEGRATION TIMES As said in Section 2, the exploited prototypal GPR allows to gather data with three couples of antennas and allows to reconfigure the integration times of the and received radiated harmonic tones, being the GPR system a stepped frequency one (Noon, 1996). In the exposition of the subsequent sets of data gathered in Malta, it has been exposed how in some situation the most promising data were at low frequency (as at Golden Bay), in some other cases they were at medium frequency (Laferla Cross, Madliena tower, Santa Maria Church) and in some other cases they were expected at high frequency (co-cathedral of St. John). Indeed the system gathered three sets of data for each site, and for further possible future analyses we have other data beyond those shown in this report. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  63  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  B-scan N1  B-scan N2  B-scan N3 Fig. 21 – B-scans gathered in the main nave of the co-cathedral of St John  The reconfiguration of the integration times was performed everywhere except that for the data of the Golden Bay, where we did not succeed in doing it for some technical problems solved only after that (first) prospecting. So, the data of Laferla cross, Madliena Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  64  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  tower, Santa Maria church and St. John co-cathedral have been achieved after a reconfiguration of the integration times. We will show here how the system is able to recognize the interferences according to the algorithm described in the introduction, and we will show how the data are is two cases slightly cleaner after the reconfiguration of the integration times. Indeed, the effects of the interferences are not strong in the cases at hand, both because there was no strong source of interference close to the investigated areas and because the prototype has default integration times quite longer than those of a commercial system. Said that, in Fig. 22 the results of the measure of the variance of the tones (see the introduction) for the data of Laferla Cross and of the Madliena tower are shown. As can be seen, in both cases the most disturbed frequencies are those in the lower part of the range 50-1000 MHz. This happens most times, first of all because there are the FM broadcast transmission that usually have the band reserved for them around 100 MHz, and also because the shielding of the antennas of the GPR is customarily less efficient at low frequency. However, we can appreciate that the level of the variance measured at Laferla cross is much higher (3 orders of magnitude) than that gathered in the Madiena tower. This is coherent with the fact that Madliena tower is an historical building with quite thick walls that isolate the inner room from the external environment, where Laferla Cross in a site outdoor. In Fig. 23, the variance of tones for two scans gathered outside the church of Santa Maria is shown. In this site we gathered two calibration B-scans in order to check whether the graph of the variance of the tones were strongly dependent on the position of the B-scan. The two B-scans were at about 20 meters of distance from each other and are not parallel to each other, and were on two different sides of the building. As can be seen, the results are not the same, and indeed the level of the disturbance can change even of one order of size or more, but the most disturbed frequencies are the same. In particular, we can see a peak around 100 MHz, and one around 200 MHz in both cases. We have then been informed Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  65  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  that there is a radio station somewhere near, transmitting with the carrier at 99 MHz, which explains the higher peak.  Fig. 22 – Upper panel: the variance of the tones in the site of Laferla Cross; Lower panel: the variance of the tones in the site of the Madliena tower. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  66  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Apart from this, the measure witnesses the reliability of the method, because the most disturbed frequencies are essentially related to the area and not the particular B-scan.  Fig. 23 – The variance of the tones measured along two B-scans outside the church of Santa Maria Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  67  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  In Fig. 24, the variance of the tones recorded in the co-cathedral of St. John is shown. Indeed, we first measured the variance shown in the upper panel of Fig. 24, and then we saw the transceiver devices assigned to the staff of the co-cathedral (which nowadays is also a museums). So we gathered a second calibration, along the same measurement line after switching on a transceiver. The carrier of this device is at 446 MHz, and coherently, a localized disturbance is visualized at this frequency in the lower panel of Fig. 24. We can see that the disturbance due to the receiving-transmitting devices is at a level much higher than the previous recorded one, which instead was of the same level as that recorded in the Madliena tower (also in this case, if fact, we were indoor and in an historical building with thick partially isolating walls). The transceiver devices could not be switched off for security reasons, and so we decided to calibrate the reconfiguration on the basis of the possible interferences from such devices. Incidentally, since the most relevant results were expected from the higher frequencies, in this case, the disturbances at low frequency visible in the upper panel of Fig. 24 were even more negligible. On the basis of the measure of the variance, we set the factor F equal to 10 for the low and the medium frequency antennas in the sites of Laferla, Madliena tower and Santa Maria church, taking F=1 for the high frequency antennas in these cases. Instead we set F=10 for all the antennas for the co-cathedral of St. John. The prolongation factor of the integration time for each tone is shown in Fig. 25. In Fig. 26, the same observation line walked through two times, without and with reconfiguration, is shown with regard to the site of Laferla. An homologous quantity with respect to the site of the Madliena tower is shown in Fig 27, and with respect to the site of Santa Maria church is shown in Fig. 28. Finally, the same comparison is shown in Fig. 29 with regard to the site of the cocathedral of St. John. With regard to the synoptic images of Figs. 26-29, we see some effects especially in the sites of Laferla and of St. John, whereas in the sites of Santa Maria and Madliena Tower, the effects are not appreciable.

Upper panel: interferences gathered with the receiving-transmitting devices switched off. Lower panel: interferences gathered with the receiving-transmitting devices switched on.  With regard to the site of the Madliena tower, this is easily understood because of the isolating walls, as said. Outside the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  69  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Santa Maria church, there was interference stronger than in the Madilena tower, but it was above all on the low frequency antennas, whereas we have considered the medium frequency antennas for the reported results. In particular, if we have another look at Figs. 23-24, we can appreciate that: 1) the level of the interference is in any case weaker at the Santa Maria Church with respect to the site of Laferla,  Laferla  Madliena tower  Santa Maria church  St John co-cathedral  Fig. 25 – The prolongation of the integration times set for each couple of antennas and for each investigated site.

CONCLUSIONS In this report we have presented the main results achieved during the STMS “Use of GPR and standard geophysical methods to explore the subsurface”, performed in sites of geological and/or Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  72  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  cultural interest in the island of Malta. Integrated GPR and passive seismic measures have been performed, and examples of reconfiguration of the integration times of the harmonic components of a stepped frequency GPR signal have been performed on field data. With regard to this last point, the work is in progress, and further tests will be implemented in future in order to optimize and characterize in a deeper way the performance of the system and the effectiveness of the reconfiguration of the integration times. Let us outline that the reconfiguration of the integration times is an inedited aspect of the reconfigurable system, and the algorithm for the reconfiguration on the basis of data gathered in the field is specifically related to a recent upgrade of the system. Such upgrade has been possible thanks to previous studies, in particular obtained during the STMS mission performed by Dr. Loredana Matera in Trondheim (Norway) in June 2014 (in the framework of the COST Action TU1208) at the headquarter of the 3d-radar, which is a well known manufacturer of commercial stepped frequency systems. In conclusion, let us outline that the programmable reconfiguration of the integration time represents a technological innovation, achieved within the activities of Project 1.1 of the COST Action TU1208. 5. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION The two Institutions involved in this STMS intend to present a project together. In particular, there are bilateral bands explicitly directed to Italian-Maltese collaborations. We will also cooperate in the framework of the TU1208 Training School planned for January 2016. Independently from this, we hope to have future occasions to perform integrated prospecting, possibly also inserting additional geophysical techniques beyond GPR and passive seismic.

INTRODUCTION The durability of concrete structures and other building materials, such as timber, depends mainly on the ease whereby water and any aggressive chemical agents dissolved therein can penetrate. Therefore, measuring water penetrability in building materials is crucial mostly when structures are in service. In this context, nondestructive techniques play an important role. In particular, the electromagnetic waves emitted by Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) are very sensitive to the water content of the medium through which they propagate. This fact provides an interesting opportunity to analyse if the GPR technique allows the assessment of water penetrability in building materials with enough accuracy. In line with this, after having conducted several laboratory experiments and relevant analysis studying the capability of GPR to assess water penetrability in hardened concrete, it is necessary to develop specific processing algorithms to understand how the water penetrates and how the wave parameters will be affected in different building materials. Water content has a decisive influence on the dielectric properties of building materials. Therefore, changes in wave parameters will occur as a result of the advance of the waterfront and might provide reliable information, both qualitative and quantitative, about where the waterfront is located. In particular, the application of GPR in the building materials area is providing very promising and interesting results, which highlight Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  77  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the strong relation between wave propagation parameters (velocity and energy level) and water content. During this STSM, research activities focused on the analysis of the capability of the GPR technique for evaluating water penetration into building materials (concrete and timber), through the assessment of the waterfront advance. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM For this purpose two different experimental programs were designed and conducted: • Concrete samples were manufactured (water/cement = 0.65), which after curing (90 days) and oven drying were immersed in water for a certain time. • 4 batches of pines timber samples (Ruso, Mobila, Pinaster and Insignis) were put under study. The four types of timber were chosen among the most commercialized in Spain used for building structural purposes, so as the dimensions of the samples. In both experimental programs, the samples were immersed in water 3 cm for a certain time: see Figure 1a. After that GPR measurements were performed at specific time intervals, removing the samples from water to conduct the GPR acquisition. A 2.0 GHz centre frequency antenna manufactured by GSSI was used to carry out the measurements: see Figure 2. A metallic reflector was placed at the bottom of all samples. Regarding the concrete sample measurements, the antenna was placed over the same side of the sample that was immersed into water, since previous successful studies have been conducted placing the antenna in the dry side. But in the case of timber samples, the acquisition was performed placing the antenna in both sizes, over the immersed side and subsequently over the dry side of the samples, since it was the first attempt to detect waterfront location.

Fig. 2 – Static GPR acquisition.  Another difference in the two experimental programs was that in the case of the concrete samples the waterfront advance was possible to be estimated by breaking the sample, right after the GPR measurements: see Figure 1b. Therefore, all GPR parameters Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  79  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  will be compared with the waterfront location estimated by visual inspection. Nevertheless, it was not possible to break the timber samples after acquiring the GPR measurements; therefore the GPR parameters will be compared with the absorption coefficient. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM 3.1. CONCRETE EXPERIMENT Waterfront evolution: Firstly, water content coefficient (CA) was calculated – see Table I.  𝐶! % =  !!" !!! !!  ∗ 100  [1]  where Md is the dry mass of the sample and Mim is the mass after the immersion into water. Secondly, after breaking the sample, the waterfront depth was measured in both sides of the broken sample – see Figure 1b. The final waterfront depth (Wf) value employed to correlate with the GPR data was the average of the front line marked by visual inspection in both sides – see Table I. 3.1.1 EFFECT  OF WATER CONTENT ON DIRECT AND REFLECTED WAVE  SIGNALS  Previously to perform any measurements in the radargrams, it was necessary to understand the received signals. They were composed by two parts: the direct wave, considering this one as the overlap between the air wave and the direct wave itself, and the reflected wave at the bottom of the samples: see Figure 3. Both of them are composed by 3 peaks, respectively. To calculate the propagation velocities, it is necessary to measure the arrival times in the radargrams. But, the received direct wave is an overlap that occurs between the air wave and the direct wave itself. Therefore, it was very complex to determine which the maximum representative of the direct wave arrival is. Regarding the reflected wave, due to the fact that the wave travelled inward the material and in its path suffered attenuation and the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  80  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  effect of the media, it was also very complex to determine the exact position of the reflected arrival time.

For each sample and peak combination, the velocity was calculated with the following equation: !  !!  𝑣 = !! ! = !  ! ! !! ! ! !  ! !!!  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  [2]  81  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Where d is the half of the path that the wave travelled, d0 was the distance between emitter and receiver (4 cm) and h the width of the sample (12 cm). Finally, the velocity difference when the sample was dry and wet was determined by equation 3 and Table II.  Δ𝑣  !" !"  = 𝑣! − 𝑣!  [3]  Fig. 3 – Direct and reflected wave maximums when the simple was dry.  where vi is the wave velocity when the sample was immersed into water and vd was the velocity when the simple was dry. As it can be observed in Table II all velocity increments calculated from peak Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  82  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  D1 were found to be negatives. This was the expected result, but in the velocity increments calculated from peaks D2 and D3, the first few samples (up to a immersion time of 80 minutes) presented positive increments. They cannot be really positives, because of the water content increase. The point is that an overlap is occurring between the air and direct wave with the waterfront reflection, resulting in an offset of the D2 and D3 peaks. In addition, the velocity increments were correlated with the waterfront depth, to check which peaks combination provided a better agreement between both parameters. In Figure 4 (a), (b) and (c) the better results of these adjustments were depicted. The results show a good agreement between velocity increments and waterfront depth for all peaks combinations (R2 = 94 99%), except for the ones that were calculated with the peak D3. This result was expected, since D3 is the peak that is most affected by two signals: the direct wave and the reflection of the waterfront. Therefore, it cannot be used as representative of the waterfront evolution. Very interesting adjustments were found when using peak D2. As describe above this peak is also affected by the 3 signals, as D3, and also positive velocity increments were obtained. Nevertheless, it is very interesting to point out that even this mix of the 3 signals correlates quite well with the waterfront advance. These results are of quite importance, because even if we are not able to locate the waterfront reflection or if it was overlapped with the direct wave signal, we might predict the waterfront position with high reliability. In particular, the peaks combination calculated with peak D1 to assess the velocity increments presented an excellent correlations, which best one is plotted in Figure 5 combination peak R1 D1.

EFFECT OF WATERFRONT REFLECTION ON THE SIGNALS The next step was to process the waterfront reflection. From sample 1 to sample 15 the waterfront reflection was overlapped with the direct wave - see Figure 6. Nevertheless, as the waterfront depth increased its signal become more easily identifiable (from sample 16 to sample 24). The waterfront reflection consisted on 3 maximums (F1, F2 and F3). But only when the waterfront reflection is separated from direct wave can be identified. Prior to any calculation of the waterfront location, it was necessary to check if the waterfront identification was correctly performed. With this aim the best correlation between the arrival times of the direct and reflected peaks and the waterfront peak was calculated.

As it can be observed in Figure 7 an excellent agreement was found between peak D2 of the direct wave and F3 of the waterfront reflection. Likewise, excellent results were found when relating peak R3 of the reflected wave and F3 of the waterfront. These results are of great importance, because that means that the GPR technique working with only one commercial antenna of 2 GHz central frequency has enough sensitivity to detect a waterfront that ranges from 0,52 mm to 4,66 cm. Even in the case that the waterfront reflection is overlapped with the direct wave, as it occurs, for the first 16 samples (345 minutes of immersion) the offset produced in the direct wave can be related with the waterfront arrival with high reliability.

WATER CONTENT EVOLUTION Firstly, water content coefficient (CA) was calculated following equation 1, and the complete results are detailed in Table III.

This is a first difference between concrete and timber samples, since not all timber species follow the same pattern in relation to water absorption, regardless of their density. 3.2.2. EFFECT  OF WATER CONTENT ON DIRECT AND REFLECTED WAVE  SIGNALS  After a first qualitative inspection of the radargrams, it was observed that the signals were not specially affected by the water absorption – see Figure 8, regardless where the antenna was placed (over the immersed or dry surface) and the analysed parameter (velocity and amplitudes). Only in same cases the amplitude traces were found to be affected by water content. This will be later discussed. It was not observed a pattern of the signals alteration due to the density of the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  89  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  samples or the quantity of water absorbed. In deed the best results were obtained with the Mobila samples, which total water content increment was found to be 2,38 %. On the contrary, the Pinaster samples had a total increment water content of 12,31%. Therefore, it was expected that the signals were more affected. Nevertheless, this was not the case, since the worst results were found for this timber specie.  Fig. 8 – Typical traces registered in Pinaster samples when it was 20 and 120 minutes immersed into water.  3.2.3. ANALYSIS OF VELOCITY INCREMENTS AFTER IMMERSION To confirm whether or not the velocities of the waves were affected by the water content increase, propagation velocities were calculated with equation 2. After that, the velocities increments between when the samples were dry and immersed in water were calculated following equation 3. In order to check if there was correlation between these increments and the water content increment different adjustments were conducted. The best results are summarized in Table IV.

In the cases, that correlations higher than the 60 % were found, the resulting equation of the adjustment presented a reliable tendency. In Figure 9, two examples of these agreements are depicted. Considering the non homogeneity of the timber samples, these results wouldn´t be very negative. But, the problem relayed on the few cases that these acceptable correlations were found. Therefore, it was not possible by means of this experiment to confirm that in timber samples, it was possible to detect the water content absorption; in particular using wave velocities increments.

Peaks R2 and R3 showed a good agreement for 3 of the 4 species analyzed. These results would be of great interest, in case they were obtained for all species. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Therefore we are not in the position to confirm that this amplitude peaks variation provided reliable enough information about the water content variation in timber. 4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION The STSM has been very productive and rewarding. To have the possibility to discuss the results with Professor Jean Paul Balayssac and Professor Gilles Klysz has been a great opportunity to learn more about GPR signals processing. As a result, future collaborations have been foreseen regarding, on one side, further processing of the data of concrete experiment; and on the other side, the possibility to design a new experiment for timber samples. Results of concrete experiment are very promising and we will continue collaborating, since further analyses might be conducted to achieve the last goal of the experiment: the assess in cm the location of the waterfront advance. In relation to the timber experiment, the results were not found as good as expected. We have been discussing about the requirements that a new experiment should meet, to improve the reliability of the results. 5. FORESEEN PUBLICATIONS/ARTICLES RESULTING FROM THE STSM Results of concrete experiment are very successful and interesting. But, further processing should be performed to achieve the last goal of the research: to assess the waterfront location. As far as this last step will be completed, we have considered the possibility of collaborating to write a paper describing the achievements and submit it to a journal in the Construction Engineering area, In reference to the timber experiment, we are in a too preliminary step to consider publishing any of the results obtained so far. Previously, it is necessary to improve the experiment design.

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this STSM was to study the sensitivity of GPR electromagnetic waves to moisture variation in wood material in relation with the direction of fibers and polarization of Electromagnetic field. The relations between relative permittivity and moisture content and the amplitude attenuation with distance was a target study using the direct waves in Wide Angle Radar Reflection (WARR) configuration, where one antenna is moved while the other remains stable. The measurements of the travel-times with WARR method were recorded with different separations between Transmitter (T) and Receiver (R) antennas. Comparison of results measured with reflected waves and direct waves was of main importance as from other works it is clear that they have different behaviour in relation with moisture variation, due to the different path of propagation. Several studies have been carried out by the I2M team, University of Bordeaux, using direct and reflected waves for the evaluation of water content on concrete materials and wood [1-3]. As related to the wood material there is one study carried out using the reflected waves on wood for different humidity and different wood samples, in all the direction of polarization using GPR technique at 1.5 GHz ground coupled antenna [3]. The direct wave method was tested in one sample with humidity 12% and dimensions: 19 cm wide, 18 cm thickness and 60 cm longitude. The measurements were carried out in only one direction Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  96  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  of propagation (electric field polarized perpendicular). The results show that the direct wave signal is measurable. In addition, the permittivity measured with the direct wave is lower than that measured with the reflected wave due to the fact that both waves have different propagation directions with respect to fibre. As a consequence this work continued with different moisture content in order to study the behaviour of direct waves as function of moisture. The interesting part of using the direct wave (the wave that propagates between the transmitter and receiver is that it doesn’t need neither a reflector nor the thickness of the sample. The comparison with reflected method of these results was one of the topics of this STMS in order to overcome the difficulties that come from the slowness of WARR method. Results taken from the measurements are compared with those from FO (reflected method) with one antenna (1.5 GHz or 2.6 GHz), realized from the previous studies from the I2M and already published [1-3]. The extraction of dielectric constant, velocities from direct waves (WARR) and reflection methods and comparison of the taken results was another goal of this STMS. 	 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM	 The GPR approach used during this work consisting in using both methods: direct wave measurements using the WARR method and reflected method, by transmitting a very short electromagnetic pulse into the material using ground coupled antenna with central frequency 1.5 GHz as a transmitter and as receiver another antenna. The measurements were carried out in one wood sample of type Epicea (Spruce), with dimensions: longitude 600 mm, width 190 mm and thickness 176 mm - see Figures 1A, 1B.

The method used was WARR, in order to study the velocity of EM and evaluating the real permittivity in relation with humidity by mass water. The measurements started in humidity of 12%. After that, the wood sample was immersed into the water and during the monitoring of its humidity, measurements were carried out in two directions ((A) longitudinal direction where the electric field was polarized perpendicular, (B) transversal directions where E is polarized parallel – see Table I). Humidity by mass water (%) was calculated with the following expression:  𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦 % =  !!!! !!  100  (1)  where, W0, is the weight of the sample with 12% humidity, W the weight of the sample after immersing into the water. The weight of the samples was measured with a balance in grams.

The scope of measuring like that was to study the variability of direct+ wave velocity when the electromagnetic field is polarized in two directions perpendicular and parallel to the wood fibers respectively. In order to have a distinction between reflected and direct waves, a metallic plate was set to the à bottom of the wood sample – see Figure 2. In this way, the abrupt changes in dielectric properties between metallic plate and the sample caused Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  101  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the reflection of EM field where it was recorded and amplified by the receiving antenna. 	 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM Introduction The electromagnetic wave propagates in air with the speed of light (0.3 m/ns). In the wood structure, which is a dielectric anisotropic material, the velocity of electromagnetic wave is reduced, since it is dependent on the relative dielectric permittivity, 𝜀! , the relative magnetic permeability, 𝜇! , and the electrical conductivity, 𝜎 [4-7]. The velocity of electromagnetic waves in a host material is given by: !  𝑣= !! ! ! !  (2)  !! !!(!/!")! !  where c, is the electromagnetic wave velocity in vacuum (0.3 m/ns), 𝜀 = 𝜀! 𝜀! the dielectric permittivity, and 𝜀! the dielectric permittivity in free space (8.854·1012F/m), 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓 the angular frequency, where f is frequency, and the expression 𝜎/𝜔𝜀 is the loss factor. In non-magnetic (𝜇! = 1) low-loss materials as wood, where 𝜎/𝜔𝜀 ≈ 0, the velocity of electromagnetic waves is reduced to the expression:  𝑣=  ! !!  (3)  The Equations 1 and 2 show that the velocity of electromagnetic waves propagating in the material is decreased compared to the velocity in the air. In low-loss (i.e. resistive) materials the maximum decrease is a factor of nine, which is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in fresh water (0.034 m/ns, [4]). Several processes lead to a reduction of the electromagnetic signal strength. Among the most important processes are attenuation, spherical spreading of the energy, reflection/transmission losses at interfaces and scattering of energy. Scattering is due to objects with a dimension similar to Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  102  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the wavelength and is therefore most pronounced for higher frequencies. Special attention should be drawn to the attenuation, which is a function of dielectric permittivity, 𝜀, magnetic permeability, 𝜇, and electrical conductivity, 𝜎, as well as the frequency of the signal itself, 𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓. The attenuation coefficient isexpressed as: !!(  𝑎 = 𝜔 𝜀𝜇  ! ! ) !! !"  (4)  !  In low-loss materials, where 𝜎/𝜔𝜀 ≈ 0, the attenuation coefficient is reduced to: 	  𝑎=  !  !  !  !  	  	  	  	  (5)	  	 The attenuation is proportional to the electrical conductivity, which leads to high attenuation in materials with high electrical conductivity. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is affected by the presence of moisture content, density and grain and also depends on the frequency of the emitted electromagnetic field [412]. For this reason, GPR is becoming increasingly successful to characterize moisture content of different building materials [7-12]. Regarding timber, there are studies that analyses the capability of GPR technique to assess the principal physical parameters such as dielectric anisotropy, moisture content, density, etc. Authors such as [1-5] have focused their research on the ability of the GPR direct wave for non-destructive testing of concrete structures with successful results. These results are of practical interest because sometimes it is difficult to detect the reflection in the opposite side of a sample, when applying the technique onsite. 4. GPR MEASUREMENTS DESCRIPTION Dielectric relative permittivity was measured using direct wave recorded by GSSI SIR 3000 system connected to a couple of Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  103  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  1.5GHz ground-coupled antennas on the Epicea (Spruce) wood sample, monitoring the humidity as the sample was immersed into the water as described in section 2. For the direct wave method (WARR), the distances between transmitter and receiver were 16 to 26 cm and 11 to 21 cm for perpendicular and parallel polarization of E vector respectively. Whereas for the reflected waves, the distance between receiver and transmitter used were 16 and 11 cm respectively for perpendicular and parallel polarizations. The arrival times were taken with Radan Software and Matlab. For each measurement, the direct air wave and direct wave on the sample were recorded – see Figure 4, 5. From the direct waves for each distance (16-26 cm) for the case where E field is polarized perpendicular and 11-21 cm for the case where E field is polarized in parallel direction is determined the velocity from direct waves from those picking arrivals (positive picks), as the slope of the linear regression of arrival time of direct wave versus the distance, as shown in Figure 6 for the case of 18.18% humidity. For the determination of the velocities from the reflected waves an aluminium plate was placed on the bottom of the wood sample – see Figure 1, 2. The picks used for calculation of velocity with reflected method are the positive for the direct wave (+D) and the positive for the reflected wave (+R) as depicted in Figure 4 ,5, where the following expressions were used: For the direct air wave in the point +D, the arrival time is: !"#$ 𝑡!"# = 𝑡! + 𝑡!"# = 𝑡! +  !!" !!

(9)  Where h, is the distance between the surface of measurements and the bottom of the sample (thickness of the sample), The dielectric constant of the wood sample is calculated from the expression:  𝜀! =  !! ! !  (10)  where V0 is the velocity of light (30cm/ns), 𝑉, is the velocity of the propagation on the wood. The dielectric constants were calculated using the expression 10. In Table II are presented the values of the real permittivity (dielectric constants) for different humidity for both polarizations (perpendicular and parallel to wood fibres), whereas in Figure 7, 9 the graphs of this variation. The dielectric constants for different humidity by mass water of reflected waves method were calculated for distances between Transmitter and Receiver 16 cm when the E field is polarized perpendicular, and 11 cm for the case where E field is polarized parallel to the fibres - see Figure 1, 2. The values are presented on Table II, whereas the graphs are presented in Figure 8, 9. As seen from the Figure 7, 9 and Table II, from the WARR method, there is small change of dielectric constants in both directions of polarization (the maximum value difference 0.35), and a linear increase of values with moisture. This happens due to the fact that propagation of EM field has the almost the same direction as in the case or radial polarization depicted from previous studies [1-3, 11-12]. As related with the reflected waves, Figure 8, 9, and Table II, the values of dielectric constant in relation with humidity change significantly with the direction of polarization of the vector Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  108  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  E, and those results are in agreement with previous works [3, 1012]. There is a difference on the values of dielectric constant where the field is polarized perpendicular in comparison with values when the E field is parallel to fibres.

This is because the reflected wave has a path that is completely different from the direct waves. The direct waves propagate in the upper part of the sample and the effect of the polarization is small and it behaves like the radial polarization, because the direct wave propagates parallel to fibre for both polarizations. Whereas the reflected wave propagate entire the wood thickness and the effect of anisotropy is significant. From the measurements we conclude that for the case where E field is perpendicular to fibres, the direct waves can be distinguished above 60% humidity but it is almost impossible to detect the arrival times of direct waves above 43% humidity in Figure 7, 9b, when the E field is parallel to the fibres, because the signal is lost and the picking of their amplitudes cannot be realized.

AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS The amplitude attenuation with distance was another topic of this work. For every water mass humidity (%), the amplitude from the direct waves was normalized with the amplitude of direct air wave. In Figures 10 and 11 is presented the variability of the normalized amplitude of the direct wave with the distance and humidity. As seen from Figure 10, the amplitude has an exponential attenuation with distance as depicted from previous works [1-3, 10-12]. With increasing humidity the normalized amplitude of the first distances is greater than one, for the perpendicular polarization, and this may be caused due to a superposition of direct wave with direct air wave in smaller distances [11, 12].

With increasing humidity, the normalized amplitude increases and starts to decrease after 33% and 25% humidity, for perpendicular and parallel polarization respectively. This conclusion should be proved with other measurements on different kinds of wood (different densities), in order to have a clear picture of it. Further analysis will be carried out on the existing data for the amplitudes of the reflected waves at distances between transmitter and receiver 16 cm and 11 cm for perpendicular and parallel polarization of E field respectively, in order to see their behaviour as a function of humidity. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  113  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  6. CONCLUSIONS From the above discussion we conclude that the main results of this work are as follows: The results taken from this work from the reflected waves, show that the effect of wood anisotropy is significant on the variation of relative permittivity with moisture content on wood sample and that is in good agreement with the previous results [1-3, 10-12]. As related the direct waves, a small change in the dielectric constants exists between transversal and parallel directions. The dielectric constant shows values that coincide with the case of radial polarization of the EM field. This can be explained from the propagation path of direct waves. Since the EM field of direct waves, propagates in the upper part of the sample, the effect of polarization is almost the same in both directions as it is the case of radial polarization when the reflected method was used. As related to the amplitude attenuation, it can be seen that in the case where the E field is perpendicular to the fibres, the amplitudes of direct waves increase with humidity and their normalized values represent values greater than 1. This can be explained by the fact that the direct air wave and direct wave in wood could be superimposed when the distances between receiver and transmitter are small. Such results were taken from the previous work with direct waves in one humidity experiment in wood [11, 12]. This effect is greater with increasing humidity up to 33% and after that we have a decrease, due to the fact that with increasing humidity the velocity in wood sample is lower and the distinction between direct air and direct waves is clearer then the water polarization effect is predominant. This is an important result and needs to be verified with other laboratory experiments on different wood species, with different water mass content and density, in order to clarify whether this behaviour is the same. With increasing humidity, the attenuation of the signal is more when the E field is parallel to the fibre direction and the WARR method cannot be used for humidity higher than 50%, because it is impossible to detect the direct wave.  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  114  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  However the WARR methods functions well, when the E field is polarized in the direction perpendicular to the wood fibres. 	 7. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION The STSM was fruitful and interesting results were collected. For the future, the experimental work with the direct wave method (WARR) on different wood samples should continue, in order to clarify the effect of wood anisotropy and moisture content on GPR direct wave propagation. We hope that this work will continue in the future in the host laboratory (I2M, University of Bordeaux), in the frame of any further project, or else at the Institute of the visiting scientist in Albania (IGEWE, PUT), since there is scientific knowledge there to make the experiments, but unfortunately this is impossible for the moment because of the lack of the necessary equipment. This can hopefully be solved in the frame of COST Action TU1208 initiative “GPR for everyone”, where IGEUM and UPT can be provided with GPR equipment for scientific work, from the more developed countries participating in the Action. 8. FORESEEN PUBLICATIONS/ARTICLES RESULTING FROM THE STSM The results of this scientific work will be presented during the 2016 EGU GA. Moreover, they will be published on: 1. Albanian Journal of Technical Sciences (AJTNS). Editor: Academy of Sciences of Albania. 2. With further analysis and interpretation and after discussion with the host Institution (I2M, University of Bordeaux), a paper can be send for publication to the an international peer-reviewed journal. We also plan to cooperate with the Action Chair for the preparation of such article.

INTRODUCTION The use of GPR in transport infrastructures represents one of the most significant advances for obtaining continuous data along the road, with the advantage of operation at traffic speed and of being a non-destructive technique. Its main application, so far, has been the evaluation of layer thicknesses, which is traditionally determined by core drilling and test pits [1]. For the determination of layer thicknesses it is necessary to know the velocity of the signal, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material, and the two-way travel time of the reflected signal that is recorded by the GPR system. The calculation of the dielectric value of the materials can be done using different approaches such as: using fixed values based on experience; laboratory determination of dielectric values; applying the surface reflection method; or performing back calculation from ground truth references, such as cores and test pits [2][3][4]. The problem with using ground truth is that it is time consuming, labour intensive and intrusive to traffic [5], in addition, a drill core is not necessarily representative of the whole surveyed area. Regarding the surface reflection technique, one of the problems is that it only measures the dielectric value from the layer surface and not from the whole layer. Recent works already started to address some of these challenges proposing new approaches for GPR layer thickness measurements using multiple antennas to calculate the average dielectric value of the asphalt layer [6][7], taking advantage of significant hardware improvements in GPR resolution and accuracy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM Different air-coupled calibration methods were compared to evaluate the applicability of each method to different pavement structures. Three methods were studied: Coring, Surface Reflection Method (SRM) and Common Mid-Point (CMP). The STSM was divided into the following tasks, which will be explained in more detail in the next sections: • • •  	  •  Task 1: Compilation and analysis of GPR survey data using different calibration methods: Coring, SRM and CMP Task 2: Comparison of calibration methods and evaluation of their application to different pavement structure solutions. Task 3: Preparation of a paper to be submitted to an international journal covering the main results of this research. Task 4. Final report of activities.	  2.1 COMPILATION  AND ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT CALIBRATION METHODS:  GPR SURVEY DATA USING CORING, SRM AND CMP  The data was collected in a test site in Portugal and three test sections with different pavement solutions were evaluated (Fig. 1 − Structure of the test sections). For each cell, two parallel survey lines with a length of 1.00 m, spaced 0.30 m apart, were made Fig. 2 − . Two control points were defined for each profile, located at 0.30 m and 0.60 m from the start of the survey line. The location of the survey lines, the direction of the surveys and the control points are presented in Fig. 2 − b.

Fig. 2 − (a) Test site, (b) survey lines and control points.  Two pairs of air-coupled bistatic antennas with central frequencies of 1.0 GHz and 1.8 GHz – see Figure 3 – and a SIR 20 acquisition unit, both from GSSI, were employed in the tests. The GPR data were acquired with both frequencies along the survey lines in a dynamic mode (scan by distance) and also in static mode Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  120  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  (scan by time) over the control points. The air-coupled antennas were suspended at about 0.45-0.50 m from the surface. The setup used for the acquisition is presented in Table I.

These data were later used while calculating the dielectric constant through the surface reflection method. For the 1.8 GHz air-coupled antenna, GPR data was also collected varying the distance between the transmitter and the receiver antenna. The first set of measurements was made over the control points using the classic method of the Common MidPoint with air-coupled antennas – see Figure 4 left. The separation between the antennas was increased from 0.34 m up to 1.00 m with increments of 0.02 m – see Figure 4 right. 	  Fig. 4 − CMP configuration over the control points (static mode).  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  	  122  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  For the second approach using the CMP method the acquisition was made in a dynamic mode and for each survey line the GPR data was recorded using three different antenna separations. The setups considered distances between the receiver and the transmitter antennas of 0.28 m, 0.67 m and 1.00 m, respectively – see Figure 5. 	 	  	 Fig. 5 − CMP configuration along survey lines (dynamic mode).

The analysis of the processed data showed that it was not possible, with the setup used within the tests, to obtain results from the CMP calibration method in a dynamic mode, essentially due to limitations of resolution of the data. Further tests should be implemented in the near future to try to overcome these limitations. Therefore, and considering the GPR tests performed, the following calibration methods were selected to be studied within this STSM – see Table III. 2.2 COMPARISON THEIR  OF CALIBRATION METHODS AND EVALUATION OF  APPLICATION  TO  DIFFERENT  PAVEMENT  STRUCTURE  SOLUTIONS.  The GPR data was processed using three different methodologies for calibration, the algorithms used in the calculation and the main results for each method are presented below. The comparison of  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  124  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  the results obtained for each calibration method is presented in Section 3 of this report. 	 (i) Coring The coring calibration method can be used to calculate the dielectric value of the asphalt layer at selected points where the layer thickness is known. For the application of this method at each control point the layer thickness of the asphalt layer was measured from the core drills. Then the two-way travel time of the reflected signal was determined from the GPR static data collected. The velocity of the propagation of the wave through the bituminous layer was calculated accordingly to equation 1 and finally the dielectric value was estimated using equation 2: !  d = v 							 !  	  v≅  (1)  !  	  !  (2)	  where c represents the speed of light in vacuum (0.3 m/ns). The results of the velocities and the dielectric values for the asphalt layer by the Coring method are presented in Table IV for the 1.0 GHz and the 1.8 GHz air-coupled systems, respectively. The 1.0 GHz antennas provided higher dielectric values (and more homogeneous) than the 1.8 GHz antennas.

(ii) Surface Reflection Method The Surface Reflection Method can be used when air coupled antennas are employed and relies on the comparison of the amplitude from the pavement surface with the amplitude from a metal plate reflection.

The amplitude of the reflection from the metal plate was obtained from the calibration files collected before the GPR tests. One A! was determined for each pair of antenna frequency and cell. From the GPR dynamic data acquired along the survey lines Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  127  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  we gathered the amplitudes of the reflection of the surface and the two-way travel time through the asphalt layer. With both reflection amplitudes (A1, Am) the dielectric values along the survey lines were estimated with Equation 3. For the transformation of the collected profiles into layer thickness profiles Equation 1 was applied, whereas the wave velocity speed was calculated from Equation 2. The results of the velocities and the dielectric values for the asphalt layer obtained from the Surface Reflection Method, over the Control Points, are presented in Table V for the 1.0 GHz and the 1.8 GHz air coupled systems, respectively. The 1.0 GHz antennas provided higher dielectric values for Cells 3 and 4 (and more homogeneous) than the 1.8 GHz antennas.

Figure 9 shows the application of the CMP method varying the distance between the ground-coupled antennas (a), identifying the types of waves that are generated during the survey (b) from the direct waves on air and on ground, to the reflected waves and its representation in the radargrams (c). For the present case air-coupled antennas were used Figure 4 and some adaptation to the processing of the data had to be undertaken, since the electromagnetic waves differ from the usual CMP analysis. The air-direct wave loses strength as the air-coupled antennas are separated and it is difficult to identify its reflection on the radargrams and also the direct ground wave does not exist as the antennas are suspended above the ground and the “ground” is the air itself. 	 	  	 Fig. 9 − Example of CMP method using ground-coupled antennas Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  130  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  The processing of the CMP data was made using the Reflex program. The first stage was to correct the start time of the signal and since we do not have the direct wave we used the first reflection which must have a velocity of 0.3 m/ns (the velocity of the electromagnetic wave on the air). This was made by setting the shot position to 0 m and the receivers from 0.34 to 1.00 m and fitting the air/ground reflection using a velocity of 0.3 m/ns. Figure 10 illustrates the signal before (a) and after (b) the start time correction. 	  (a)	Before	start	time	correction	  	  (b)	After	start	time	correction	  	  Fig. 10 − CMP signal start time correction	  Using these modified data we selected the CMP-velocity analysis to determine the velocity of the propagation of the wave within the first layer. Because of the huge velocity contrast of the layers (air vs ground) we could not use the semblance analysis (that generates mean velocities) as the resulting layer velocity could become smaller than 0, which is not realistic, and a warning message appears. So in this case we use the manual velocity adaptation and adjust the reflection varying the boundary and the velocity of the hyperbolas of the CMP-velocity analysis – see Figure 11.

A more detailed statistical analysis is presented in Table VIII.

INTRODUCTION This STSM contributed to the achievement of the objectives of Working Group 3 of the COST Action TU1208. It was a continuation of the work that we started during a previous mission (April 3rd – 10th, 2015) [1], which results were meanwhle presented during the “IEEE 15th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)”, Lecce (Italy), Nov. 2015 [2]. Directions of Arrival (DoA) techniques enable an antenna array to estimate the number of incident signals and their arrival directions. A Sub-Array Processing (SAP) approach can be adopted for the detection of targets lying in the near field of an antenna array. In particular, the receiver array can be partitioned in several sub-arrays, such that the field scattered by the targets can be assumed to be locally planar at each sub-array. Then, by applying DoA estimation algorithms, it is possible to predict the dominant direction of the incoming signal at each sub-array. By triangulating all DoAs estimated by the sub-arrays, a pattern of crossings can be obtained. This pattern can be filtered in order to remove a noisy background of unwanted crossings [3]. Subsequently, the number of targets and their positions can be estimated. Our first STSM focused on the use of SAP-DoA approaches for the location of reinforcing elements in concrete. As a first step, we reviewed our previous work on SAP-DoA techniques and suitably modified our Matlab codes, in order to be able to use them for the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  138  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  processing of the Fourier-transform of Ground- Penetrating Radar (GPR) radargrams. A second task was concerned with overcoming the limits of DoA algorithms, which are designed by considering a narrowband signal model: we worked on extending the approach to the case of an ultra wideband signal. Because of the limited time at our disposal, we opted for a simple solution of the latter issue – there was and still is room for further improvement. Finally, we performed preliminary tests on synthetic data, calculated by using gprMax. In particular, we worked with the reference data of TU1208 Concrete Cells 1.1-1.3 [4] (see Figure 1.1) and we also simulated enlarged versions of these cells. As expected, we obtained more accurate results when the distance between objects was larger and their interaction weaker. Based on the results we obtained during the first STSM, during the second STSM we focused on the following tasks: • We analysed more in depth the results obtained for the enlarged versions of Cells 1.1-1.3 and obtained additional results, in order to assess in a more comprehensive way the accuracy and limits of our approach in the presence of multiple scatterers versus the distance between them (Days 1-3). • We compared the accuracy of our method and the standard time-domain hyperbola approach (Days 4-5). At the end of the second STSM, we also planned our future activities. We look forward to testing our approach on experimental data: we plan to employ it for the processing of some sections of the TU1208 dataset coming from measurements performed at the IFSTTAR Geophysical Test Site (Nantes, France). Depending on our time availability, we would also like to improve our approach during a longer STSM, in order to exploit in a smarter and more advanced way the multi-frequency information enclosed in the GPR data. A final STSM will be devoted to implementing a graphicaluser interface and writing a user manual, as we intend to release our codes for free public download by the end of the Action.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM AND OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED  2.1 SIMULATION, BY USING GPRMAX OF THE TU1208 CONCRETE CELLS  AND  E2GPR,  OF ENLARGED VERSION  The identification of buried cables, pipes, conduits, and other cylindrical utilities, is an important task in civil engineering and is nowadays extensively studied. Most commonly employed approaches are based on the use of electromagnetic sensing such a GPR systems, in order to extract information about the scenario and localise the sought objects. Nevertheless, innovative techniques must still be developed in order to mitigate the Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  140  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  drawbacks of existing approaches, especially when real-time operations are needed. As recalled in Section 1, during the first STSM we applied our SAP-DoA approach to the TU1208 Concrete Cells 1.1-1.3 proposed in [4] and to enlarged versions of them where the distance between the objects was increased of 10 cm. During the second STSM, we carried out further simulations by using the electromagnetic simulator gprMax and the additional tool E2GPR [5-6], where we gradually enlarged the cells with a 5cm step. For each Cell, five versions are now available, as shown in Figures 2.1 - 2.6 and resumed in Tables I - III: the original cells, and cells where the distance between objects is increased by 5 cm, by 10 cm, by 15 cm, and finally by 20 cm. 2.2 THE HYPERBOLA APPROACH: DEVELOPMENT OF A MATLAB PROCEDURE FOR THE FITTING OF HYPERBOLAS IN GPR RADARGRAMS When the radar signal impinges on circular-section rebar embedded in concrete, it is scattered and reflected due to the discontinuity of permittivity. As the GPR antenna is shifted along the surface of a concrete layer, the presence of circular-section rebar is translated into the radargram as a hyperbola. The scattering properties of rebar strongly depend on the polarization of the electromagnetic field emitted by the radar and by the size of the rebar with respect to the incident wavelength. Everything becomes much more complicated when the section of rebar elements is not circular. As for the polarization, if the electromagnetic field emitted by the radar is linearly polarized, rebar reflections can be maximized by varying the antenna orientation. These issues have significant implications for rebar detection, survey design, and data interpretation.

In a co-polarized antenna configuration, both receiving and transmitting antennas have the same polarization properties: rebar yield strong reflections when oriented parallel to the long axis of the dipoles, weak reflections when oriented orthogonal to the axis of the antennas. A crosspolarized antenna configuration is less sensitive to smooth planar targets and more sensitive to targets that yield depolarized energy. It is therefore very important to consider polarization when planning and executing a GPR field survey, as the sensitivity of cross-pole and co-pole antenna arrangements are different depending on the type of target and subsurface conditions. Optimization of antenna orientation, to take advantage of signal polarization, is a significant feature for a successful location of reinforcing bars in the radargrams. Note that all simulations presented in Section 2.1, both the receiving and transmitting antennas are parallel to the rebar axis. One of the most commonly used methods for the estimation of rebar size in concrete from GPR data is the hyperbola approach. In order to be able to compare this approach with our SAP-DoA method, we implemented a Matlab procedure for hyperbola fitting. This is based on a Minimum Mean Square Error technique [7]. Let us consider an ideal vertical transverse-axis hyperbola with coefficients a and b, centred at the origin of a xy Cartesian reference system.

If the curve is a perfect hyperbola, then all the points (xi, yi) satisfy Equation (1) and the error due to hyperbola-fitting of the curve is zero. For real field hyperbolic signatures in a radargram, (xi, yi) do not perfectly lie on a hyperbola. For any point (xi, yi), the error e can be defined as the difference between the left and right hand sides of the Eq. (1). Thus the square error e2 is: !  𝑒 =  ! !!!  1−  !! ! !!  +  !! !  !  !!

In particular, the position error is reported (actual position - estimated position) for the hyperbolic fitting and for the SAP-DOA estimations. In Figure 2.10, the error is plotted as a function of the horizontal distance between adjacent objects. As expected, the SAP-DOA method error decreases when the objects are more distant one to another. For Cell 1.1, the hyperbolic fitting estimation is much more robust than the SAPDOA methods, when objects are closer than 30 cm. We wish to investigate what happens when the rebar size becomes larger: in such case, both the hyperbolic fitting estimation and the SAP-DoA approach will show a worse behaviour, due to the fact that the objects will not anymore lie in the far-field of the antennas. Table V shows the localization results for Cell 1.2, for all the considered versions of it. In Figure 2.11, the rms error is plotted as a function of the horizontal distance between adjacent objects. Again, the SAP-DOA method error is higher than the hyperbolic fitting estimation. Moreover, in this case, we observe Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  158  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  TABLE IV – CELL 1-1: COMPARING LOCATIONS ESTIMATED BY MEANS OF HYPERBOLIC FITTING AND THOSE ESTIMATED BY THE SAP-DOA APPROACH.

This is due to the presence of dielectric objects with cavities in this case study and is consistent with the A-scans reported in [1] for the original not enlarged cell (see the unusual time delays of the reflections by empty objects, there). Table VI shows the localization results for Cell 1.3, for all the considered versions of it. In Figure 2.12, the rms error is plotted as a function of the horizontal distance between adjacent objects. As objects of Cell 1.3 do not have a circular section, the center position has been considered as the mean x, y point. In this case study, the SAP-DOA method seems to be more robust than the hyperbolic fitting estimation. This is due to the fact that, in this case, objects have non-circular section. This result shows that the SAP-DOA method can be used successfully to detect targets in concrete different than pipes and tubes: in such cases the hyperbola approach cannot be adopted, whereas our SAP-DoA method can still provide a useful estimation of the target size.

CONCLUSIONS In this STSM, the accuracy of the SAP-DoA localization technique was investigated, versus the distance between the sought objects. Moreover, the technique was compared with the standard hyperbola approach, which is commonly employed for the interpretation of GPR data. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  161  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  	  Horizontal distance between adjacent objects [cm]	  Fig. 2.11 – RMS estimation error versus object mutual distance for Cell 1.2 a-d (4 simulated cases).  We applied the SAP-DoA technique to the synthetic reference data of TU1208 Cells 1.1-1.3 and to new enlarged version of these cells. In these scenarios, several metallic and dielectric targets embedded in concrete are considered; such targets have different shapes and they are embedded at different depths in the hosting cells. Matlab functions and scripts have been developed, to extract the time-distance information from the B-scan and perform the hyperbolic interpolation. As expected, the accuracy of the SAP-DoA techniques improves when the distance between the reinforcing elements embedded in the cell is increased and their electromagnetic interaction becomes weaker. Moreover, the accuracy of the hyperbolic interpolation method is higher when circular-section cylindrical objects are sought. Nevertheless, the situation is different for the localisation of objects with non-cylindrical shape. In this case, the hyperbola approach cannot be employed whereas the SAP-DOA method can still provide interesting results. Regarding the detection and localization of objects with noncylindrical shape, the SAP-DOA method proved a significant precision in estimating the object position, compared with the traditional hyperbolic fitting estimation method.

Combine the SAP-DoA approach with Support-VectorMachine (SVM) techniques, in cooperation with the University of Genoa. These techniques are expected to increase the robustness of our approach with respect to the distance between sought targets, as they are more powerful than standard DoA algorithms in coping with electromagnetic interactions between objects. Depending on our time availability, we would like to improve our approach during a longer STSM, in order to exploit in a smarter and more advanced way the multifrequency information enclosed in the GPR data. A final STSM will be devoted to implementing a graphicaluser interface and writing a user manual, as we intend to release our codes for free public download by the end of the Action.

A template for the slides was prepared and Members were asked to contribute to the various modules by preparing the lectures or else by making available their teaching material. A huge amount of material was collected. Our STSM objectives were: to examine and organise the teaching material made available by Action Members; to improve the lecture template; and to prepare the slides for some lectures. Additionally, part of the STSM was devoted to implementing and executing a realistic electromagnetic model of a column, for which  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  168  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  experimental data collected by the visiting scientist were available. This activity was not foreseen in the STSM workplan. 	 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM 2.1 EDUCATION PACK As mentioned in Section 1, we examined all the teaching material made available by Action Members and tried to organise it. Then, we improved the lecture template. For example, we improved the way in which References are presented and additional material is listed. We decided to include photos and short biographies of the Authors at the end of each lecture. Most of the time was devoted to preparing slides. Alessio Ventura (Roma Tre University) and Santo Prontera (Sapienza University) participated to the preparation of the slides. We focused on the following submodules (among parentheses, we indicated the current status of the submodule, after the STSM): 	 Module 1: Introduction to GPR (to be improved) Module 2: GPR antennas (rather complete) Module 3: Overview on the civil-engineering applications of GPR (to be improved). Bridges and Tunnels (rather complete). Buildings (rather complete). Module 4: Electromagnetic modelling (rather complete). 	 The status of the Education Pack was subsequently presented during the Fifth General Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal (March 2-4, 2016). 	 2.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC MODELLING OF COLUMNS	 Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  169  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  As mentioned in Section 1, we devoted part of the STSM to simulate a masonry column of the “Hospital de Sant Pau” in Barcelona, Spain. For this column, experimental data previously collected by the visiting scientist were available. The GPR assessment of some columns in old buildings of the “Hospital de Sant Pau” was carried out by the visiting scientist, as a preliminary stage of a structural analysis of the buildings preceding their complete restoration. One column was removed from its original place and moved to the laboratory of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. The survey presented two main difficulties: the first one was to adapt the B-scans to the shape of the columns Figure 1; the second one was related to the large number of irregular scatterers inside the columns, because the columns were built by using irregular pieces of bricks, arranged in a sort of “star” configuration. The experimental radargrams obtained for these columns are not easy to be interpreted, due to their complicated structure. Inside the columns there is a metallic tube and, in some parts of the radar images, the tube seem to disappear.		 The diameter of the columns was 64 cm. Inside each column there was a metallic tube (a drainage pipe) of 8 cm diameter. Externally, the column is composed by 12 cm × 6 cm rectangular glazed fired clay breaks. Inside of the column, the bricks, irregularly distributed were bounded with portland cement. Radar data were acquired along the column and also along perimetral radar lines schemes in Figure 2. The distance between the perimetral lines were 3 cm, and the distance between the lines along the column, 5 cm.

The distance between horizontal lines (perimetral) was 3 cm. The distance between vertical lines (along the column) was 5 cm.  	  A commercial Ramac radar (Mala Geoscience) was used in the test, with a 1.6-GHz centre frequency antenna. The position of the antenna on the column was determined with a survey-wheel odometer. During the radar acquisition, the sampling frequency was	 86,200 MHz, obtaining 672 samples per trace. The spatial sampling was 0.002 m, and the temporal window was 8 ns. Some preliminary tests in the columns of the building indicated that the average wave velocity was about 10 cm/ns. These tests were carried out with direct measurements, knowing the diameter of the column and obtaining the reflection on a metallic target placed on the opposite side of the antenna. Later and more accurate measurements, using a specimen under laboratory conditions (this Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  172  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  specimen was one of the columns that was moved to the laboratory), indicate that the average velocity could be higher, close to 13 cm/ns. Two examples of the radar images obtained in both type of radar lines are shown in Figure 3. In these data, under the first arrival, heterogeneous anomalies highlight the irregular structure of the column. During the STSM, a series of electromagnetic models were implemented and executed, for the column moved to the laboratory. The TU1208 freeware tools gprMax and E2GPR were used. The purpose of the simulations was to support and ease the interpretation of the experimental radargrams. The first model was a realistic one, where we tried to reproduce the section of the column in the best possible way, by using available photos of the column. The geometry of a horizontal section of the column and the synthetic B-Scan are reported in Figure 4. The subsequent models were simplified and more regular from the geometrical point of view, they helped us to understand the scattering phenomena occurring inside the column. An example of such simplified models is presented in Figure 5. In all our models, we assumed for concrete and bricks a relative permittivity equal to 7 and 11, respectively. The relative permeability was equal to 1. The conductivity of materials was neglected at this stage. Improved simulations will adopt a Debye model of the media, in order to take into account their conductivity and frequency-dispersive properties. The spatial discretisation step of the model was 1 mm; consequently, the time discretisation was calculated by using the Courant condition. We employed Perfectly Matched Layers with 20 layers in our models. The pulse emitted by the GPR had a Ricker time shape and its spectrum was centred on 1600 MHz. The source was a line of current and the model of the receiver was neglected. These simulations were performed with the help of Daniele Pirrone (Roma Tre University, TU1208 WG Member).

INTRODUCTION The COST Action TU1208 aims to promote, throughout Europe, a wider and more effective use of the GPR technique in the monitoring of both infrastructures and structures, as it is stated in the Memorandum of Understanding. In order to achieve such objective, the Action is carrying out dissemination activities at different levels and is developing guidelines for a correct use of GPR in various civil-engineering tasks. The dissemination activities include a series of initiatives devoted to explaining GPR basic principles and civil-engineering applications to stakeholders and end-users. Strategies for a stronger stakeholders and end-users’ involvement in the COST Action were extensively discussed during the Third General Meeting in London [1]. During the Fifth General Meeting in Lisbon, a working team started mapping GPR European stakeholders/end-users profiles. In parallel, dissemination seminars started taking place in different Countries, in particular the first successful seminar was held in Lisbon in occasion of the Fifth General Meeting and it was attended by more than 100 representatives from private companies and local authorities, further seminars are planned in Italy, Czech Republic, Croatia, Greece, Romania and Poland. In the described framework, this STSM aimed at achieving two objectives: the first one was to organize and improve all the relevant material collected during the Fifth General Meeting of COST Action TU1208 in Lisbon, according to the Stakeholders engagement steps Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  178  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  described and agreed in [1]; the second objective was a strategy for the development of multimedia material concerning Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) conceived to disseminate both GPR basic principles and civil-engineering applications of this technique. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM The work performed during this STSM was mainly carried out by Mr Patrizio Simeoni and Dr Lara Pajewski. It also benefitted from the contribution of Mr Santo Prontera (TU1208 WG Member, Sapienza University, Italy). The work started with a review and finalisation of the Stakeholders profile table, created in Portugal during the Fifth General Meeting, as well as of a report containing such table and resuming the results of the Lisbon seminar [2]. The original table was constituted of a list of Stakeholders profiles relevant for GPR and grouped by “application field”. In occasion of the STSM, it was recognised the importance of adding two columns, the first one indicating the Working Group relevant for every specific application field and a second one containing the available TU1208 resources for such field that could be provided to both Stakeholders and end-users. In the latter column, the following questions were answered: • • • • •  Are guidelines being prepared, under preparation or out of scope for this application? Is the state of art completed, in progress or out of scope for this application? Are there TU1208 Case Studies available? Will flyers be prepared? Is this application relevant for TU1208?  The table, when completed, was merged back into the original report, to avoid a dispersion of information. After completing this task, a first instance of the table, containing Stakeholders profiles in Italy, was prepared with the double objective of starting an actual Stakeholder mapping and to provide an example to Members Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  179  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  in other Countries showing how the table should be filled in. The table prepared, which is available as “Annex A” to this report, is going to be sent to all TU1208 MC members, along with the draft of the report [2]. The table will be filled by MC members collecting information about all Stakeholders in their Countries, this will permit TU1208 to feed Stakeholders/final users with useful information about GPR applications or seminars. During the STSM it was also observed that the material available on the TU1208 website, even when relevant, is not in a form which is useful to Stakeholders and final users who are mainly interested in Case Studies. It was therefore decided to reorganise the relevant information and add to the website a new page including a list of TU1208 Case Studies. For each case study, the items listed below will be provided: 1. Case Study site. 2. Complete reference details of the paper or report where the Case Study is presented and described. 3. Contact of a member of the TU1208 COST Action who contributed to the paper and is available to provide further information and/or answer to questions/doubts about the Case Study proposed. 4. Additional information/comments. The table is going to be published on the above-mentioned new page of the TU1208 website and it will evolve in time. The table is identified by a version so that Stakeholders and end-users may be able to verify newer/different releases present on the website. The so called “Case Studies” table, in its actual version, is attached as “Annex B” to this report. This draft version won’t be released on the website; the table will be published only after having formally reviewed its contents, and after having added at least few more Case Studies. Moreover, the fourth column (links and comments) present in the draft version, that was included with the only objective of helping the review process, will be removed or strongly modified before publishing. Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  180  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Finally, a flyer template was developed. The idea is to realise a series of flyers presenting the most important civil-engineering applications of GPR, plus a flyer on COST Action TU1208 and on GPR basic principles. Few software tools (e.g. Microsoft Publisher) were initially considered but finally it was decided to design the flyer by employing Microsoft PowerPoint because this instrument is commonly used by most of the researchers and engineers involved in TU1208. It was decided that the flyer page format will be an A4 and that each flyer will include 4 pages, therefore the flyer itself was developed as an A3 page. The flyer-template content was chosen according to common strategies applied in flyers designed by commercial Companies and in particular: 1. Front page, for which the content is Application dependent, is constituted by: a. Top Banner containing COST Logo (header). b. Title of the Application. c. Subtitle. d. Picture. e. Short description. f. Footer containing TU1208 website link. 2. Back page, for which the content is generic and applicable to all flyers, is constituted by: a. Top Banner (header). b. Description of COST and its primary objectives. c. Description of TU1208 and its primary objectives. d. Relevant Contacts. e. Footer containing COST website link. 3. Internal pages, having application dependent content, in this case the only fixed/non modifiable part is the top banner (or header). Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  181  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  The proposed flyer template, filled with some random data to help visualising the final product, is attached as “Annex C” to this report. The actual flyers will be created from the template described above with the cooperation of other experts involved in TU1208. The table in [2] describes all Case Studies scenarios (or application fields) for which flyers are planned or relevant. The flyers will be hosted in the TU1208 website in pdf or jpg format and will be sent via email. Flyers will also be printed for hand-made distribution, therefore a folder was designed to contain them, the prototype of the folder is attached as “Annex D” to this report. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM The main objective of this STSM was to setup a cooperation in order to produce material that will be used to improve stakeholders and final users’ awareness on the TU1208 activities. The objective was achieved by designing and realising tables and strategies as described in the Section 2. Five working-days, planned for this STSM, were obviously not sufficient to complete all the activities started, but they were enough to setup the activities and tune the different ideas to make it possible for the researchers involved in this task to continue working in their respective labs. Such coordination could not be achieved without carrying out this STSM. 4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION A future and continuous collaboration with the host institution is a mandatory requirement for the success of the heavy task started during the STSM, this will be achieved through regular planning and review of the status of the Stakeholder engagement activities listed in this report. Coordination with the host institution will be required when future dissemination activities will be planned. Mr Patrizio Simeoni and the host institution will moreover cooperate to support, coordinate and review actual flyers that will be designed with the help of other TU1208 members.

FORESEEN PUBLICATIONS/ARTICLES RESULTING FROM THE STSM A tangible result of this STSM will be the publication of the Case Study table on the TU1208 website. A final paper describing the Strategy adopted for dissemination by TU1208 and all results achieved will be written when the Stakeholder Engagement and Dissemination Activity will be completed. This final article will hopefully help other COST Actions to try and start an analogous process. The paper will describe the overall activity started in London in occasion of the Third General Meeting and in which this STSM was a major milestone, it will contain results achieved and issues encountered during the development of this task.

INTRODUCTION This STSM focused on the use of different electromagnetic simulators, implementing different aproaches for spatial discretization and different numerical techniques for the solution of Maxwell’s Equations, to develop accurate and realistic models of antennas in GPR scenarios. In particular, we compared the FiniteIntegration Technique (FIT), implemented in the commercial tool Microwave Studio by Computer Simulation Technology (CST), and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique, implemented in the new version of gprMax, the free open-source solver developed in the University of Edinburgh as a contribution to COST Action TU1208. Furthermore, we started testing the effectiveness of gprMax for other electromagnetic applications. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK CARRIED OUT DURING THE STSM The work carried out during the STSM was mainly concerned with the simulation of GPR antennas. In particular, before the STSM we modelled two commercial bow-tie antennas for Ground Penetrating Radar: GSSI 1.5 GHz and MALA 1.2 GHz. The Roma Tre University research team focused on modelling them by using CST Microwave Studio. The University of Edinburgh team modelled them with gprMax and collected experimental data. During the STSM, we finalised the series of comparisons that we carried out in remote  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  204  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  collaboration. Preliminary results of our joint work were presented in [1]. More results will be presented in [2]. Next, for simple scenarios involving a dipole and a half-space, we carried out simulations to compare gprMax and CST results with the results of integral methods developed in Croatia, by the University of Split research team. These comparisons will be presented in [2]. Finally, another aspect of this STSM was to demonstrate that is possible to achieve a good agreement between CST Microwave Studio and gprMax not only in the GPR context but also for other electromagnetic applications. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM 3.1 GPR ANTENNAS As already mentioned, the first part of the STSM focused on finalising comparisons of synthetic data obtained by using two different tools for electromagnetic modelling of GPR scenarios: gprMax and CST Microwave Studio. In Figures 1 and 2 the geometry of the simulated GSSI antenna is shown. In Figure 3, crosstalk results obtained with both tools are presented; the unknown parameters were optimised, in order to obtain the best agreement between the output data given by models. In Figures 4-6, the same as in Figures 1-3 is presented for the MALA antenna. More results can be found in [1, 2]. 3.2 DIPOLE ANTENNA Once the optimization of GSSI and MALA antennas was finalised, we focused on the simulation of a wire dipole antenna. For this simple antenna, we compared results of CST Microwave Studio, gprMax and Croatian codes implementing integral methods.

Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  207  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  Different simulations of the dipole were performed, in free space and over several soils with different properties: • Lossless half-space with relative permittivity 𝜀! =10; • Lossy half-space with relative permittivity 𝜀! = 10 and conductivity ;σ = 1 mS/m; • Lossy half-space with relative permittivity 𝜀! = 10 and conductivity σ = 10 mS/m. The CST model of the dipole is shown in Figure 7. For each scenario, we calculated the current at the centre of the dipole, and the electric field at different distances. When the half-space was present, the distance between the dipole and the soil was 0.1 m: see the geometry in Figure 8. Results were calculated at 0.5 m, 1 m and 1.5 m depth. The antenna was excited by a voltage source with a Gaussian-shaped waveform in a gap between the arms of the dipole: ! ! 𝑉 𝑡 = 𝑉! 𝑒 !! (!!!! ) (1) where 𝑉! = 1 𝑉, 𝑔 = 1.5 ∗ 10! s-1, and 𝑡! = 1.43 ∗ 10!! s. Figures 9-24 show the results of the simulations of the abovelisted scenarios for the FDTD, TDIE and FIT simulation methods. 3.3 WOODPILE EBG Another purpose of the STSM was to show that gprMax can be successfully applied to scenarios not concerned with GPR. We decided to consider the simulation of a woodpile electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) superstrate, designed to increase the directivity of a patch antenna. Indeed, for such structure several HFSS results and experimental data are available [3, 4], recently obtained in Italy by researchers working in Sapienza and Roma Tre Universities. More time is needed to complete this activity: the gprMax model has to finalised, simulations have to be carried out in order to obtain gprMax results and compare them with HFSS results and with measurements. We are not able to present results in this report. The geometry of the considered structure is shown in Figures 25 and 26.

In CST microwave studio there is a macro function, which allows to easily include biological media or entire human-body models in the scenarios; the human-body models belong to the socalled “CST Voxel Family” of CST models. This is a set of seven human model voxel data sets created from seven persons of different gender, age and stature. Table I and Figure 27 give an overview of the seven models. The properties of the biological media Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  218  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  were recalculated, during this STSM, by using the 4-Cole-Cole formulation at a given frequency. The formula and parameters that we used are available in [5]. More time is needed to bring forward this activity and obtain results. 4.

INTRODUCTION This work was a continuation of the previous STSM TU1208-26813 carried out by Igor Prokopovich at the National Institute of Telecommunications, Warsaw, under supervision of Prof. Marian Marciniak. The main goal of both missions was the development of an efficient semi-analytical simulation technique for the problems of subsurface electromagnetic probing with ground penetrating radar (GPR). Although there exist accurate numerical algorithms and computer codes modelling electromagnetic (EM) wave emission and propagation in non-uniform subsurface medium, analytical approaches can provide better physical insight and dramatic acceleration of quantitative estimates. Our work is based on the rectification of classical WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation put forward by Bremmer and Brekhovskikh in the 50-ies of the last century. It consists in iterative solution of the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) of WKB type (“coupled-wave method”, “two-way WKB”) [1-2]. This approach accounts for the backscattered signals and provides a good accuracy in a wide frequency range [2]. The possibility of applying coupled-wave theory to GPR by solving 1D inverse problem has been studied in [3]. It was shown that the time-domain counterpart of Bremmer-Brekhovskikh method allows one to accurately reconstruct the parameters of subsurface Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  221  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  transition layers, starting from the waveform of the return radar pulse born on the permittivity gradients. Our work was aimed at further development of BremmerBrekhovskikh approximation applied to GPR problems. As the onedimensional (1D) probing scheme considered in [3] was oversimplified, we have developed a more realistic model: ultrawide band (UWB) EM probing of a horizontally layered half-space by a GPR with separated dipole antennas lying at the ground-air interface. The use of Fourier-Laplace transform reduces the problem to an ordinary differential equation, which is solved approximately by Bremmer-Brekhovskikh method. The backward integral transform yields an approximate representation of the time-domain Green function – subsurface medium response to an elementary current jump in the GPR transmitter antenna. General equations of the coupled-WKB approximation were derived during the first STSM by I. Prokopovich. The present work was aimed at the numerical implementation, verification and practical application of this prospective semi-analytical method. 2.

Equations (5-7) provide explicit approximate representation of the time-domain Green function for an arbitrary permittivity profile 𝜀(𝑧), which, in combination with Duhamel principle, solves simulation problem for an arbitrary EM pulse.

From physical considerations one can expect that the main contribution to the time-domain Green function Gr make the values of parameter w closest to GO. Ray interpretation suggests an efficient method to solve the functional equation (8). Maximum simplification can be achieved if the separation between the transmitter and receiver antennas is relatively small. In this case the angles of arrival are small, we can consider w~𝑖/𝑝 as a  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  227  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  large parameter and look for the roots of Eq.

In such a way, it ε (ς )  transforms to a quadratic equation (s-S)w2 ± ixw – P = 0 having two roots of interest. As a result, the kernel (5) becomes:  K ( x, z , s ) =  ε0 cε ( z )  (  )  ε0 +1  2  4 P( z ) ( s − S0 ) − x 2  So, for a moderate separation between the antennas, the essential component of the Green function, responsible for the signal reflected by the permittivity gradients, can be written in a closed form: +  Gr ( x, 0, s ) =  +  Z  ε0 c  (  )  ε0 +1  2  ε ʹ( z )  ∫ ε ( z) 0  dz  (11)  4 P( z ) ( s − S0 ( z ) ) − x 2  2  Here, Z is a root of the equation 4P( z) s − S0 ( z) − x = 0 corresponding to the depth level from where the partly reflected signal starts towards the receiver along a geometric-optical path. In virtue of the assumption p~𝑖/𝑤, our approximation is similar to the method of coupled parabolic equations that was used by Claerbout in the problem of seismic prospecting [4]. In order to obtain an accurate numerical quadrature for Eq. (11) one has to take into account the algebraic singularity of the kernel  (  Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  )  228  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  +  K ( x, z , s ) at the end point Z . We introduce notation F ( z ) =  R( z ) = 4 P( z ) S0 ( z ) + x 2 and  a uniform discretization grid zµ  ε ʹ( z ) , ε ( z)  = [0 : h : zm ] ,  +  where zm corresponds to Z ( sm ) . Decomposing the integral into a sum of integrals over the intervals ( zµ −1 , zµ ) :  Gr ( x, 0, sm ) =  m  ε0 c  (  )  ε0 +1  2  Zµ  ∑ ∫ µ  =1 Z µ −1  ε ʹ( z ) dz ε ( z ) 4 P( z ) ( s − S0 ( z ) ) − x 2  and expanding functions F ( z ) , P ( z ) , R ( z ) in Taylor series we reduce (11) to a sum of standard algebraic integrals that may have singularity of the order − 1 . Finally, analytical evaluation of the 2  3/2  arising integrals yields a numerical quadrature, accurate to O (h ) and correctly describing weak singularity of the Green function at the reflected wave front. In order to estimate the accuracy of our approximate analytical solution we compared it with direct numerical calculations performed with a popular simulation tool GprMax [5]. Input data for GprMax are: geometry and electric parameters of arbitrary defined uniform fragments of the computation domain, positions of the transmitter and receiver antennas, and the excitation current waveform. In our work, a horizontally layered medium with permittivity gradually varying with depth was considered. It was defined via analytical permittivity distribution to be introduced into the integral representation of the simulated radar response. As gprMax code deals with piecewise-uniform models, in order to correlate the solutions we approximate our smooth permittivity profile 𝜀(𝑧) with discrete uniform layers of the thickness equal to the calculation grid step. As an excitation current waveform in the transmitter line antenna, we choose the derivative of Gaussian pulse – one of GprMax standards.

An idealized model of subsurface medium is shown in Figure 3. It consists of two uniform layers with constant dielectric permittivity and a smooth transition layer between them: 𝜀 𝑧 , z0≤z≤z1. Transmitter and receiver antennas are placed on the earth surface z=0. In the figure, the components of the emitted EM pulse are shown: aw and gw – “aerial” and “ground” waves, iw is the incident wave entering the transition layer, rw is the return wave arising due to partial reflection by the permittivity gradients, tw is the wave passing the transition layer.  Fig. 3 – Schematic picture of radar return signal formation. Figures 4(b) and 4(d) display the results of GPR probing (simulated A-scans) for two thicknesses of the transition layer  ε ( z) =  ε 0 + ε1 ε 0 − ε1 2  +  2  ⎡ π ⎛ z0 + z1 ⎞ ⎤ sin ⎢ z − ⎜ ⎟⎥ 2 ⎠⎦ ⎣ z1 − z0 ⎝  namely: z1-z2=2m and 6m.

Simulation has been performed using our coupled-WKB approximation (solid line) and GprMax code (dash line). The first double pulse corresponds to the direct surface wave moving along both sides of the ground-air interface. A weak signal with large delay arises due to cumulative partial reflections from the non-uniform transition layer. One can note that, notwithstanding the approximate character of WKB method and additional errors due to quasi-vertical approximation, the accuracy of the coupled-wave simulation is excellent from the practical point of view.  (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  Fig. 4 – Vertical profile of dielectric permittivity and simulated UWB EM pulse at the receiver point (coupled WKB – solid line, gprMax – dash). Antenna separation X = 3m , subsurface medium parameters:  ε 0 = 81, ε1 = 25; z0 = 4m, z1 = 10m (a, b), z0 = 6m, z1 = 8m (c, d) It must be also noted that the required computing time with our semi-analytical approach is about 100 times less, compared with purely numerical simulation. A satisfactory qualitative similarity between exact numerical simulation and approximate coupledWKB estimates persists even for large separation between the antennas, when the propagation path is far from the vertical. There is a permanent search for deeper sounding methods, the main Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  231  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  solutions are the increase of radiation power and the reduction of pulse central frequency. New features appear in the lowest GPR frequency band. If the subsurface medium contains inhomogeneity which scales are comparable with the pulse wavelength, peculiar protracted return pulses appear in the radargrams. In this case, diffraction effects are to be engaged for GPR data explanation. As an example, we considered long return pulses obtained during GPR-assisted search for a large fragment of Chelyabinsk meteorite, in 2013, that felt into Chebarkul lake bottom [6]. According to diver’s witnesses, the lake floor is covered with a 2-3 meter thick silt layer. We supposed that the protracted reflected signals were formed due to partial reflection at the gradual permittivity transition from pure water to the solid bottom. Numerical simulation with coupled-wave WKB conformed this hypothesis. 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THE STSM The fundamental result of this work is an approximate analytical solution of a GPR subsurface probing problem. We consider a horizontally layered subsurface medium and a bistatic scheme of GPR probing with dipole UWB antennas. The solution has been obtained by extension of the classical Bremmer-Brekhovskikh (coupled-WKB) approximation to time domain. We have derived an analytical expression of the received pulse being the result of partial reflections from the permittivity gradients. Comparison with popular numerical tool gprMax demonstrates surprisingly high accuracy of our approximate solution, along with substantial acceleration of the calculation. As a result of this STSM and the previous one, this work is completed, proven and ready for publication. 4. FUTURE COLLABORATION WITH THE HOST INSTITUTION Possible topics of further collaborations are: extension of the theory to three dimensions and to the case of smoothly varying layered media with slow permittivity dependence along x and y axes. The STSM has strengthened the existing links between guest and host institutions owing to an excellent networking tool offered Publisher: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Faculty of Civil Engineering Osijek  232  Ground Penetrating Radar – Issue 1 – September 2017  by the COST Action.
