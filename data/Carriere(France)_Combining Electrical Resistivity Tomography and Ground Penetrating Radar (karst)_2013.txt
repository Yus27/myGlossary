Both selected techniques, 2D Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), are widely used in environmental studies and their application is accessible for a lot of scientists/engineers. However, GPR or ERT alone is not able to provide an enhanced characterization of geological features in karst media. In the present study, GPR results supply a near surface high resolution imaging and thus can provide relevant geological information such as stratiﬁcations and fractures. Despite the quality of the results GPR's investigation depth remains limited to around 12 m. Apparent and inverted resistivity provided by ERT surveys shows strong lateral and vertical variations. These variations can inform about general geological structuring and feature orientation. ERT is able to prospect down to 40 m but it's a low resolution integrative technique. In the study area the investigated limestone is a commonly electrical resistive formation (more than 2000 Ω.m). However deeper than 5–7 m, the ERT proﬁles reveal several zones of moderate resistivity (around 900 Ω.m). In these zones a stratiﬁcation change corresponding to slanted bedding is clearly identiﬁed by GPR results. The combination of both GPR and ERT results can allow a well-established geological interpretation. These moderate resistivity zones with slanted beddings can explain the presence of a perennial water ﬂow point 35 m below the surface of the studied site within the underground gallery of the Low-Noise Underground Laboratory (LSBB). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction The structure of karst hydrosystems is highly heterogeneous and the related hydrodynamic functioning mechanisms can be complex in both unsaturated and saturated zones (e.g. Bakalowicz, 1995; Ford and Williams, 2007; Goldscheider and Drew, 2007; Mangin, 1975; White, 2007). The karst aquifers represent important groundwater resources around the world. 25% of the world population is supplied with water from karst aquifers (Ford and Williams, 2007). Due to the triple porosity (matrix rock, fracture and karst conduct), the complexity of a karst environment makes water exploitation and protection difﬁcult and challenging. The study methods used in classical hydrogeology (bore holes, pumping tests and distributed models) are generally invalid and unsuccessful for karst aquifers because the results cannot be extended to the whole aquifer nor only a part, as is done in non-karstiﬁed aquifers. Generally, karst hydrogeologists use a speciﬁc investigation methodology (described in Bakalowicz, 2005), which is comparable to that used in surface hydrology. Most of the time, these aquifers are modelized using ⁎ Corresponding author. Tel.: +33 490 14 44 92. E-mail address: simon.carriere@alumni.univ-avignon.fr (S.D.

This lack of knowledge makes the parameterization of distributed hydrogeological models difﬁcult and only few authors take up the challenge (e.g. Worthington, 2009). Thus, it's still necessary to improve our knowledge and understanding of karst structures and functioning. This research is focused on the Unsaturated Zone (UZ) which plays an important role for water storage in the karst hydrosystem (Emblanch et al., 2003). Karst UZ is particularly complex because matrix rock and fracture play a major role in water ﬂow regulation but this mechanism is still poorly known. Ground-based geophysical methods can play an important role in the study of these systems. But suitable characterization of heterogeneities in the karst environment is very challenging and the choice of adequate methods remains mainly site related (Chalikakis et al., 2011). This paper is part of a larger hydrogeophysical project in karst media. Our global goal is to develop an effective methodology for near surface geophysics aiming towards a better understanding of water transfer and storage within the UZ of karst hydrosystems. This project aims at answering the following question: can we link water storage and water transfer, within karst UZ, with parameters  32  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  measured from surface geophysics? This paper is devoted to the ﬁrst step of this project. We will exhibit efﬁciency and complementarity of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and ERT surveys for geological feature-enhanced descriptions. Seismic surveys could also provide relevant information in karst media (Šumanovac and Weisser, 2001). However, acoustic waves which are widespread in Rustrel limestone present a wide wave length (about 40 m). This wide wave length induces a low resolution of seismic surveys. Time domain electromagnetic techniques have only been used a few times successfully (Chalikakis, 2006; Ezersky et al., 2006, 2009), mainly to locate the upper part of a sedimentary buried karst system and characterize the overlying sedimentary covering. Very Low Frequency was successfully used in several studies to detect epikarst, also to map karst near-surface heterogeneities (e.g. Bosch and Müller, 2001, 2005; Guérin and Benderitter, 1995; Ogilvy et al., 1991; Turberg and Barker, 1996) but this technique provides a limited resolution compared to the aims of this present study. Slingram EM31 and EM34 are efﬁcient in ﬁnding zones of interest like sinkholes (e.g. Jardani et al., 2007; Valois et al., 2010) but in the studied site, this material touches its limit of sensitivity range and measurements are unstable. With adequate environmental conditions, the self potential technique is well ﬁtted to detecting preferential pathway in karst media (e.g. Jardani et al., 2006; Robert et al., 2011) but the intense plant activity and presence of an electrical line within the Low-Noise Underground Laboratory (LSBB) tunnel excluded this technique. Guérin et al. (2009) successfully used mise-à-la-masse to detect waterﬁlled cavities. Air-ﬁlled cavities are routinely detected with gravimetric surveys (e.g. Benson and Floyd, 2000; Beres et al., 2001; Camacho et al., 1994). Gravimetry is used in hydrogeological surveys to study rock density variations over time (e.g. Deville et al., 2012; Jacob et al., 2008, 2009). Magnetic Resonance Sounding (MRS) is particularly efﬁcient in detecting water-ﬁlled cavities (Boucher et al., 2006; Vouillamoz et al., 2003). MRS is recently used to study water content within karst UZ (Mazzilli et al., 2012) but this technique is inefﬁcient in studying karst structures. GPR techniques appear to be the most popular geophysical tools for identifying and locating near surface karst features (cavities, conduits and fractures) at less than 20 m depth (e.g. Al-Fares et al., 2002; Benson, 1995; Beres et al., 2001; Grandjean and Gourry, 1996; McMechan et al., 1998; Pueyo Anchuela et al., 2009). The ERT technique, robust and reliable, is also widely used on karst media for identifying and locating sinkholes, shallow conduits or enlarged fractures (e.g. Guérin et al., 2009; Šumanovac and Weisser, 2001; Valois et al., 2010; Van Schoor, 2002; Zhou et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2011). GPR and ERT were used jointly (Elawadi et al., 2006; El-Qady et al., 2005) but never to image successfully karst near surface features. The combination of GPR and ERT surveys is routinely used in other geological contexts. Beauvais et al. (2004) used it on crystalline basement rocks. Quaternary glacial sediments were recently studied with coupled ERT and GPR surveys (Burke et al., 2012; Pellicer et al., 2012). These two techniques are also efﬁcient in investigating water table depth in weathered granites (Mahmoudzadeh et al., 2012). This paper highlights how GPR and ERT could be combined to study the structure of karst UZ in typical Mediterranean carbonate/ karstiﬁed formations. After a summary of geological and hydrogeological knowledge the adapted ﬁeld methodology and the results of each method are presented. Together with their combined interpretation provide a well established geological and hydrogeological understanding of the local karst UZ. 2. Geological and hydrogeological background The test site is located within the karst hydrosystem of the Fontaine de Vaucluse (FdV) in the South of France (Fig. 1a, b) on the LSBB site (http://www.lsbb.eu). The catchment area is about 1130 km2 (Puig, 1990) (Fig. 1b). The FdV spring (the only outlet of the system) is the  biggest karst spring in Europe with an average discharge of 19 m3/s from 1970 to 2006 (Cognard-Plancq et al., 2006). The karst system is partially developed in the low Cretaceous limestone (Urgonian) described in detail by Masse (1976). The LSBB (http://www.lsbb.eu) is an underground gallery having been dug for a military purpose and converted into a research laboratory in 1997. It is located near Rustrel village, in the southern part of the FdV catchment area (Fig. 1b). The gallery is 3.8 km long with a diameter varying between 2 and 4 m. It is almost horizontal under the mountain so that the rock cover above the gallery varies from 0 to 519 m due to the topography. As the gallery comes across the karst medium, the fault throws and the fault networks, it also intersects arbitrarily some ﬂow paths throughout the UZ. Consequently, several perennial and intermittent ﬂow points are identiﬁed in the gallery, at different depths (from 35 to about 440 m). Those have been observed and regularly sampled (hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry) inside the LSBB since 2002 (Blondel, 2008; Garry, 2007; Perineau et al., 2011). One of these permanent ﬂow points is located 50 m before the western extremity of the LSBB tunnel (Fig. 1c) where the tunnel is located only 35 m below the surface. This point is called “point D” and its average discharge is around 80 mL/min (Perineau et al., 2011). Such a geometrical context encouraged us to focus our investigations on the area located above point D (Fig. 2). Beyond the usual approach which consists in surface geophysical investigation, the LSBB tunnel provides unique underground information about karst UZ: geology, geotechnics, hydrodynamics, tectonics or hydrochemistry. This information provides useful knowledge in order to interpret geophysical results. At this place, the outcrops correspond to the U3 subdivision of Urgonian facies (Leenhardt, 1883). The U3 subdivision presents several facies (Fig. 1d) that are not always laterally continuous. Therefore, interpretations of geophysical results are very challenging and require comprehensive geological knowledge. The limestone facies outcropping on this site is a biocalcarenite with possible crossbedded stratiﬁcations. The limestone stratigraphic dip varies from 15° and 20° in a southerly direction. The whole study area is affected by two main sets of faults and fractures: 10 to 25°N and 100° and 120°N identiﬁed on aerial photos (Fig. 2c) and in situ measurements (Fig. 2b). The topography dips approximately to around 13° to the South and the surface is covered by a typical Mediterranean shrubby forest mainly composed by Holm oak (called in French garrigue). At the surface we can identify humus horizons, clayey soil and some terra rossa (Banerjee and Merino, 2011) with limestone fragments and mainly outcropping limestone (Fig. 5a). This makes the GPR and ERT implementations difﬁcult and generates locally some variations in the geophysical measurements. 3. Methodology and tools 3.1. Implantation strategy and constraints The geomorphological conditions and soil occupation on the site were not very favorable for ground-based geophysical acquisition. The typical dense shrubby Mediterranean forest is not the easiest place for geophysical measurements. Field and material conditions exclude any 3D acquisition. Thus, an alternative option was adopted, based on multi-2D acquisitions along parallel and perpendicular proﬁles. The slope, the vegetation and the gravel cover induced a very important preparation work to clear the investigable sections. Preparations of a 126 m long section on this site necessitated one day for two people to cut trees and prepare the ground. It was necessary to rake and ﬂatten ground to ensure a good contact between GPR antennas and the ground. In addition, for the ERT proﬁles the implantation of electrodes mainly at limestone outcrops was quite difﬁcult, saltwater and mud were used and sometimes electrode holes were mechanically dug within the rock to ensure good ground contact.  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  33  Fig. 1. (a) Fontaine de Vaucluse basin located in France; (b): Low-Noise Underground Laboratory (LSBB) located in Fontaine de Vaucluse basin (after Puig, 1990); (c): Extract of local geological map, no. 942 (Blanc et al., 1973); (d): Regional lithostratigraphic log (Masse and Fenerci-Masse, 2011 (modiﬁed)).  Bad contact could induce measurement artifacts during data acquisition. These artifacts are comparable to near surface inhomogeneities (Abbas et al., 2004; Ritz et al., 1999) which could deteriorate the ﬁnal inverted resistivity section (LaBrecque et al., 1996). So, it's essential to ensure good contact between the ground and electrodes even if it's a difﬁcult task in this kind of geological media. A ﬁrst ERT recognition campaign was performed in the spring of 2011 to test ERT equipment and acquisition sequences. Three 126 m sections, one North/South (actual LSBB01), one East/West (actual LSBB03) and one along the LSBB trace direction, were investigated by ERT with 64 electrodes. Each section shows a very questionable moderate resistivity zone above water ﬂow point D. After this recognition campaign, it was decided to perform two ERT sections along the North/South and four along East/West directions (Fig. 2c). This way, the geophysical survey crossed through subperpendicularly the two main faulting and lineament directions of the area. Due to practical reasons, only ﬁve of the six ERT proﬁles were used for the GPR investigations. The investigable area was also selected taking into account the “point D” location within the LSBB. 3.2. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) The high frequency electromagnetic (EM) wave length of the GPR allows the imaging of the subsurface with a spatial resolution which agrees with the geological structure sizes (stratigraphy, main karst features, …). It is a very efﬁcient tool for describing near surface features when rock permittivity is low (e.g. Al-Fares et al, 2002; Chamberlain et al., 2000; Mochales et al., 2008; Piscitelli et al., 2007).  Sénéchal et al. (in press) noticed exceptional limestone rock properties inside the LSBB tunnel for the suitable application of GPR. Moreover, because of the amplitude compensation processing, permittivity variations, in addition to geometrical information, can also be interpreted. However, the sub-surface conditions are variable along the proﬁles. In some zones, the limestone outcrops but in other zones, there is a conductive overburdened clayey soil which could limit the depth of investigation. In order to ensure favorable conditions the measuring campaign took place during May 2011 after a long dry period. Due to the vegetation in the studied area, shielded antennas (Malå RAMAC) were used for all the proﬁles. Both 100 and 250 MHz antennas were tested on the site. The 250 MHz antennas provided an adequate compromise between resolution and depth penetration. The 100 MHz antennas did not increase signiﬁcantly the investigation depth but imaging resolution was strongly diminished (Fig. 3). Thus, all the acquisitions were carried out with a 250 MHz shielded antenna. The vertical resolution of the GPR survey was empirically approximated using the tenth of the wave length. Then, the vertical resolution provided by the 250 MHz antennas was around 10 cm while in the 100 MHz antennas was 30 cm. That is true at near surface but in the depths the resolution is lower because wave attenuation is quicker for high frequency waves than low frequency waves. The deeper we descend, the dominant frequency wave is no longer 250 MHz but 100 MHz then 50 MHz. But this decrease remains poorly known, so we estimate empirically that the vertical resolution of the 250 MHz antennas ranges between 10 cm and 40 cm. Six proﬁles of 126 m lengths were carried out: two in North/South direction (LSBB01 and LSBB06) and four in East/West  34  S.D.

(LSBB03, LSBB04, LSBB05 and LSBB07) (Fig. 2a, c). The spacing traces which determined horizontal resolution were 20 cm (controlled by a wheel) because it's the same approximate size as the minimum vertical resolution, therefore inducing reasonable acquisition time. The recording time is equal to 420 ns because beyond this time, GPR signal is totally attenuated. Each trace is stacked 128 times to obtain a good compromise between signal/noise ratio enhancement and acquisition time. The knowledge of EM velocity is useful for data processing. In order to determine EM wave velocity in the ground, we also acquired a Common Mid-Point (CMP) using two 100 MHz unshielded antennas. This CMP was positioned on a point where there were limestone outcrops (Fig. 2c). As shown on Fig. 2a, the investigated zone presented some strong but smoothed elevation variations. Positioning was performed with a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) acquisition every 2 m using differential GPS (TRIMBLE GPS 5800 with TSC), with an accuracy around 1 cm for X and Y and 2 cm for Z. 3.3. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) The robustness and reliability of the ERT technique have been widely used in karst areas (e.g. Cardarelli et al., 2006; Valois et al., 2010; Zhou  et al., 2000). This technique was also chosen for sensitivity to water content. ERT is a more integrative technique than GPR. The acquisition system used for ERT survey is an ABEM Terrameter SAS 4000 (Dahlin, 2001) with 4 channels and 64 electrodes. The survey contains six 126 m long sections (2 m inter-electrode spacing), two North/South and four East/West. One of the North/South sections was extended to 252 m (4 m inter-electrode spacing). Electrode elevations were obtained by differential GPS with RTK measurements. Different arrays were carried out: Wenner–Schlumberger (WS), dipole–dipole and gradient. The characteristics and speciﬁcations of each array can be found in Dahlin and Zhou (2004). The WS protocol used and exhibited in this paper totals 1022 measurement points, maximum separation spacing “a” was 34 m, maximum separation factor “n” was 15 and maximum geometrical factor “k” was 25,635. For each array, the acquisition time was 0.1 s and the delay time was 0.2 s. Each measurement cycle spends around 1.8 s. The injection intensity ranges between 100 and 200 mA according to ground resistance. The potential measurements had a range between 0.05 and 36 V. During acquisition, if a data point present a repetition Root Mean Square (RMS) > 1%, the measurement could be stacked until ﬁve times. After the measurement, a few data points presenting repetition RMS > 1% were rejected from the datasets.  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  35  − Going deeper, GPR detects slanted stratiﬁcation. This slanted stratiﬁcation outcrops 1 km East from the studied site (Masse et FenerciMasse, 2011; Fig. 5b). GPR is also suitable for detecting reﬂector discontinuities which reveal the presence of tectonic features within the limestone bedrock (Fig. 4b). The GPR sections highlight many fractures in the limestone. The GPR also showed lateral variations of signal amplitude. In zone (At) (Figs. 4, 8), the GPR signal amplitude was strongly attenuated. These lateral variations of signal amplitude were also visible on other GPR sections. These attenuations are due to a more conductive zone near surface or deeper within limestone matrix. 4.2. ERT apparent resistivity  Fig. 3. Comparison of 100 MHz and 250 MHz GPR antennas, ﬁrst 35 m of LSBB01 section.  4. Processing and results 4.1. GPR The very low conductivity of the limestone and the close surface properties provided exceptional GPR results for karst media. The CMP analysis determined that EM waves propagated with a velocity of around 8.5 cm/ns. GPR imaging reached to about 12 m in depth according to the sub-surface condition. The data was processed using Seismix Unix software (Cohen and Stockwell, 2010). It was chosen to undergo the same processing steps for each proﬁle in order to facilitate comparison between the different sections. Processing included: (1) static correction in order to determine t0 and DC removal, (2) background removal by subtracting the mean trace from each measured trace (3) compensation of the attenuation by dividing each trace by the average envelope, which preserves relative lateral variations of amplitude, (4) frequency bandpass ﬁlter (50–70–450–500 MHz), (5) Stolt migration with velocity of 8 cm/ns and (6) time to depth conversion, using the same velocity. The CMP provides a theoretical wave propagation velocity but it is possible to adjust this value to reach optimum in terms of imaging. Thus, we chose 8 cm/ns for data processing because, at 8.5 cm/ns, some diffraction hyperbolas appear in depth and highlight a slight overvaluation of velocity. For each proﬁle, we have also applied a static correction in order to take into account the topography. Due to the important elevation slope in the North/South direction, the mean slope elevation has been removed and we have only applied residual elevation corrections. Consequently, LSBB01 section (Figs. 4, 9) is shown with relative topography integrated and the image is rotated (around 13°) according to the mean slope topography. Whereas the East/West proﬁle LSBB03 is shown with the total elevation corrections (Fig. 8). Due to the physical properties of the limestone, we observe reﬂections up to 12 m deep. Sedimentary ﬁgures appear clearly, thanks to the high resolution of GPR. Coherent signals are associated with reﬂections on the limestone stratigraphy. GPR sections clearly show two distinct stratiﬁcation features: − There are near surface regular stratiﬁcations (Fig. 4a). The thickness varies between 2 and 4 m on the section LSBB01, but could reach 6 m on other sections.  Only one array is highlighted in this paper to simplify presentations and discussions of the results. We have chosen to highlight the WS array because this is the most robust and provides results less affected by artifacts than dipole–dipole and gradient. In Fig. 6b, pseudo-depth (PsZ) was calculated using the following: Wenner array PsZ = AB / 3; Schlumberger array PsZ = AB / 2, AB is the distance between current electrodes. Apparent resistivity values were used to establish apparent resistivity maps of the studied area (Fig. 6b). Geostatistical analysis using variograms, calculated with Surfer10 software, highlights strong anisotropy in the dataset. Two contrasted directional variograms for the PsZ 3 m dataset are visible (Fig. 6c). The directional variogram: 16°N (with 16° of tolerance) shows a moderate semivariance between two points aligned along the 16°N axis at lag distance (around 45 m). The directional variogram directed 106°N (with 16° of tolerance) shows high semivariance around 20 m which corresponds to lag distance and this semivariance decreases strongly around 40 m. The geostatistical analysis of the PsZ 10 m dataset presents approximately the same anisotropy direction but it has not been exhibited in this paper. The geostatistical analysis already highlights a directional structuring. The anisotropy was considered during kriging by an anisotropy ratio associated with ﬁtted variogram models. According to the difference of lag distance between directions 16°N and 106°N (Fig. 6c), this anisotropy ratio is 0.44 in the 106°N direction for both map 3 and 10 m. The ﬁtted variogram models used for kriging are spherical models with nugget effects. These apparent resistivity maps (Fig. 6b) show an alternation of conductive and resistive bands in a 15°N direction. These bands are repeated every 40 m. This is in agreement with directional variogram: 106°N which shows signiﬁcant decrease of semivariance around 40 m. The apparent resistivity maps highlight general geological structuring in the 15°N direction. This direction is in accord with a main faulting direction (10 to 25°N) shown by the rose diagram of faults and fractures (Fig. 2b) and a main lineament direction visible by aerial photo (Fig. 2c). 4.3. ERT inverted resistivity The LSBB tunnel (purple dot) and water ﬂow point D (blue dot) are located around 30 to 50 m under the studied site (Fig. 7). In Fig. 7, a pseudo 3D visualization of the six inverted resistivity sections is visible (May 2011). The investigation depth of the 126 m long ERT section (2 m inter-electrode spacing), is about 20 m, while the section of 252 m length (4 m inter-electrodes spacing) reaches 40 m (Fig. 9). The data was processed with the Res2Dinv software version 3.59.108 (Loke and Barker, 1996) using the standard constrained and least-square inversion methods to produce a 2D model of the subsurface from the apparent electrical resistivity data. The inversion grid used is reﬁned with widths of half the inter-electrode spacing unit. The grid is distorted according to the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation method to represent topography. The iteration process was  36  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  Fig. 4.

To assess inversion quality, we chose to calculate the “Depth of Investigation (DOI) index” (Figs. 8, 9) proposed by Oldenburg and Li (1999). This index was used by Marescot et al. (2003) to assess ERT  reliability in mountain permafrost studies. The DOI index, R(x,z), is calculated for each pixel with two inversions of the same dataset using different values of the reference resistivity, as shown in Eq. (1) where m1(x,z) and m2(x,z) are inverted resistivity values from respective reference models. The ﬁrst reference value, m1r, is usually calculated  Fig. 5.

The second reference value, m2r, is usually calculated from the average of the observed apparent resistivity values multiplied by 10. The damping factor used for inversion process is 0.01. Rðx; zÞ ¼  m1 ðx; zÞ−m2 ðx; zÞ m1r −m2r  ð1Þ  To facilitate visualization, the DOI index is scaled by division using Rmax which is the maximum value of R(x,z) calculated previously. Rscaled ðx; zÞ ¼  Rðx; zÞ R max  ð2Þ  The choice of cutoff values for the DOI index is debatable. Oldenburg and Li (1999) recommend using a cutoff value of 0.1 or 0.2. What is important is to be careful in interpretation in zones where the DOI index increases quickly. In the present study, the DOI index allows the assessment of a limited depth. Beyond this limit, interpretation becomes hazardous (i.e. 20 m for 126 m long survey and 40 m for 252 m long survey). The DOI index points out some well known artifacts of the inversion process (for example, a strong resistant artifact under a conductive zone (Fig. 9)). Two noticeable points are highlighted in Fig. 7a. First, there are several near surface zones presenting high electrical conductivity. On the site, these correspond to a clayey soil overburden. Secondly,  some deeper moderate resistivity zones (around 900 Ω.m) appear on each section between 5 or 7 m and 18 or 23 m. They can clearly be distinguished from the surrounding rock. These moderate resistivity zones are placed with a noticeable concordance between each section. This coherency is particularly visible in Fig. 7a. 5. Discussions and ERT/GPR joint interpretation GPR results show lateral variation of its signal amplitude. In some zones, the GPR signal is strongly attenuated, like in zone (At) (Figs. 4, 8). In Fig. 8 the relationship between attenuation and the conductive near surface conductive zones is clearly visible. Those conductive zones correspond with the clayey soil overburden visible on the site. The clayey soil overburden attenuates the propagation of high frequency electromagnetic waves in the ground. Thus, these lateral variations are not due to real lithological variations. The apparent resistivity map provides a general vision of the studied site and shows the orientation of the geological structuring (Fig. 6). This structuring is in a 15°N direction which corresponds to the main faulting direction (10 to 25°N) and shows the major inﬂuence of this faulting direction. Thus, in order to study water variation (the following step of this project), it would be judicious to carry out ERT monitoring along the maximum heterogeneity direction and sub-perpendicular to this major East/West faulting direction. The concordance between the North/South and East/West ERT sections at their intersections could also be discussed. In Fig. 7b  38  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  Fig. 7. (a) East/West directed WS ERT results (May 2011); (b) All ERT results (May 2011), WS array, 2 m electrode spacing, 64 electrodes, standard constraints, Res2Dinv inversion in 3 iterations.  some satisfactory intersections are visible while other intersections show low coherency (Fig. 7b). The weak coherency zones are due to a strong lateral heterogeneity whereas the 2D ERT surveys theoretically require a laterally extended homogeneous and isotropic ﬁeld. Around a low coherency zone pointed out in Fig. 7b, there are strong lateral variations opposite the established satisfactory coherency zone. These low coherency intersections highlight that 2D ERT measurements are limited when the medium presents too much structural complexity and heterogeneity. This is a warning against over-interpretation of ERT results, particularly in this kind of complex geological environment. This is also a reason for using bidirectional surveys in complex media like karst to image medium heterogeneity. The 3D ERT could be an interesting solution to break through this limitation. In this way, 3D ERT could provide a better inverted resistivity model than 2D ERT measurements (Marescot, 2004; Rodder and Kneisel, 2012). However, 3D ERT is an expensive technique and, in order to investigate the same underground volume, an extremely large number of sections are needed. In addition, a 3D campaign is inadequate for difﬁcult environmental conditions (slope and dense forest).  Despite the problems of low coherency between perpendicular proﬁles, the ERT surveys mentioned in this paper show a very interesting moderate resistivity zone which could correlate with GPR results. The identiﬁed moderate resistivity zones could be related to a higher clay rate or higher water content compared with the surrounding rock. If this zone is due to water, it could partially explain the presence of the perennial water ﬂow point D located solely at 35 m depth. The ERT and GPR results in the LSBB01 proﬁle (126 m long) are shown in Fig. 8. The overlapping of ERT and GPR sections highlights the coherency between these two surveys. The regular stratiﬁcations detected by GPR agree with an electrically near surface resistive zone on the ERT section. The slanted stratiﬁcations are also in accord with an electrically moderate resistivity zone. In February 2012 a longer LSBB01 section (252 m) ERT was carried out (Fig. 9) and this investigation reached to around 40 m in depth. The coherency between GPR and ERT is particularly visible in the zoom within Fig. 9. The coherency between the moderate resistivity zone and the slanted stratiﬁcations is noticeable. Generally, slanted  S.D. Carrière et al. / Journal of Applied Geophysics 94 (2013) 31–41  39  Fig. 8.

This rock may be more porous and possibly ﬁlled with water or clay. Therefore, these slanted stratiﬁcations are electrically less resistive than the surrounding rock. The bottom of the ERT section (Fig. 9) shows a clearly resistive layer including the water ﬂow point D. This resistive layer could be related to the compact coral limestone as described by Masse et Fenerci-Masse (2011) (Fig. 1d). If that is the case, water ﬂow point D can probably be linked to a moderate resistivity zone by a fault observed in the tunnel during the LSBB digging in 1967. A geotechnical report noticed a 20°N fault precisely at the actual place of water ﬂow point D. Unfortunately, this is a conﬁdential report due to the military past of the LSBB building and the details cannot be provided. GPR results highlight many fractures within the limestone which are undetected by ERT. ERT chosen arrays and inter-electrode space are not well ﬁtted to detect fractures (Figs. 8, 9). Actually no ERT array is able to detect thin fractures to 12 m depth as well as GPR. The fractures detected could play a major role for water transit within karst UZ. These fractures could be preferential pathways for water. 6. Conclusions and perspectives Separately, 2D ERT and GPR techniques are not able to provide an enhanced characterization of the geological features within karst UZ.  However, the combined interpretation of ERT and GPR results renders a well-established geological hypothesis in accordance with geological knowledge. Coupled ERT and GPR surveys are efﬁcient and light package to study near surface features of karst UZ. In this study, for two people, approximately ﬁve days are necessary for ﬁeld preparations (trees and branch cutting, ground raking and ﬂattening), four days to carry out 6 ERT sections and one day to carry out 5 GPR sections and the CMP measurement. The 250 MHz GPR antennas provide near surface imaging with high resolution allowing accurate imaging of karst near surface features (decimetric beddings and thin fractures). Despite exceptional GPR results, GPR's investigation depth remains limited in the karst media (around 12 m in our study). Moreover, if there is a conductive subsurface overburden, the depth of GPR investigation could be limited to around 2 m. ERT survey results provide information complementary with GPR results. Apparent resistivity maps show spatially distributed information. The main orientation of the geological structures is at 15°N. This information will be determinant for ERT monitoring implantation in the next step of this project. Inverted ERT surveys of 126 m and 252 m long using 64 electrodes could reach 20 and 40 depths respectively in this geological context. Each ERT section shows a moderate resistivity zone (around 900 Ω.m) between 5 or 7 m and 18 or 23 m. This moderate resistivity zone is in accord with slanted bedding detected by GPR which is probably more porous than the surrounding  Fig. 9.
