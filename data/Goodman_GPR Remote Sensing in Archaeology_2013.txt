Series Editors:  Jay D. Gatrell, College of Graduate and Professional Studiesand Departmentof Earthand Environmental Systems, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN, USA Ryan R. Jensen, Department of Geography, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA The “Geotechnologies and the Environment” series is intended to provide specialists in the geotechnologies and academics who utilize these technologies, with an opportunity to share novel approaches, present interesting (sometimes counterintuitive) case studies, and most importantly to situate GIS, remote sensing, GPS, the internet, new technologies, and methodological advances in a real world context. In doing so, the books in the series will be inherently applied and reflect the rich variety of research performed by geographers and allied professionals. Beyond the applied nature of many of the papers and individual contributions, the series interrogates the dynamic relationship between nature and society. For this reason, many contributors focus on human-environment interactions. The series are not limited to an interpretation of the environment as nature per se. Rather, the series “places” people and social forces in context and thus explore the many sociospatial environments humans construct for themselves as they settle the landscape. Consequently, contributions will use geotechnologies to examine both urban and rural landscapes.

These researches need to be integrated with data from other disciplines to help thoroughly in delineating the history of the area investigated. In the last 20 years, various scientific disciplines have provided effective tools for an integrated approach to the knowledge, analysis and safeguard of the Cultural Heritage. In particular, geophysical prospecting methods represent an entire range of non-invasive surveying techniques, including data processing and image representation of the different data sets collected from the surface, which can enhance the knowledge of the investigated area.This book was written to appeal to researchers employing the Ground Penetrating Radar method to study the characterization and protection of archaeological and historical sites, contained in the urban territories of both major cities and small historical centres. GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology introduces Ground Penetrating Radar via understanding the complexity of this geophysical method through a simulator. The book continues with several chapters covering many of the signal and image processes needed to take the raw recorded radargrams, and showing the steps to create 3D data volumes that can be effectively used in the interpretation of subsurface archaeology. Guidelines for generating useful depth slice maps from random GPS tracks or from regularly spaced surveys using interpolation, as well as specialized processing required for hi-density surveying using the latest multichannel GPR systems are presented. Imaging techniques such as overlay analysis for placing important reflections through the depth record into comprehensive 2D maps are given extra attention. The book gives examples of case studies made at a variety of archaeological sites from around the world. Although the book is designed primarily for readers interested in archaeological investigations, geoengineering and geotechnical practitioners may also benefit by incorporating some of the processing techniques outlined.  v   vi  Preface  As described in this book, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technique is bringing new powerful tools to help archaeologists and historians in their quest of discovery and exploration. Even though this field is still in progress, the different contributions in this book give us a glimpse of the things to come and the great potential of GPR in archaeology.

For years many embraced these myths about GPR and “blindly” began applying this new technology without understanding its essential capabilities and limitations. The archaeologist’s early beliefs were that GPR was equivalent to an X-ray of the ground. Some of these myths were and still are perpetuated today. Hollywood films showing fake GPR equipment yielding the ultimate 3D image of dinosaurs skeletons generated from a single pass of radar – looking even clearer than the best MRI imaging that could be achieved at a top notch hospital – helps to keep the false capabilities of GPR alive. Many archaeologists however began to realize that GPR cannot see through the ground with perfect clarity after many applications to their sites. Sometimes the test trenches, where geological and archaeological material profiles were recorded by painstaking excavation study, showed little corroboration and equivalence on the recorded GPR profiles. GPR was also falsely accused of being unable to see anything in the near surface, particularly by surveyors that only examined the data in the profile mode. It was common early on to hear users of GPR equipment claim that the technology could not see anything in the first 15–30 cm of the radar profiles, since all the subsurface reflections were masked by the ground surface waves, and thus there was no need to use GPR when archaeology was confined to very shallow near surface regions. In addition, excuses for GPR were often made that the technology could not see anything in clayey environments and there was no reason at all to use the equipment when certain geologic conditions were at a site. Doolittle et al., (2003) and Doolittle and Collins (1995) have made GPR suitability maps which are useful in the geophysical planning stage. Many users however, would take these maps as literal sign posts on whether to give a red or green light to even begin a GPR survey. Some had tried to dispel many of the folklore and misconceptions about GPR but their voices were not heard loud enough (Olhoeft 1996). D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_1, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  1   2  1 Introduction  Early on many of the myths about GPR were also promulgated by interpreters not having access to software that could present the radar data in more advanced forms. Generation of the 3D volumes of GPR and displays of horizontal amplitude slices made from closely spaced parallel profiles taken on a site helped to provide more complete and useful data displays. Once data from GPR could be processed and more commonly presented in time slice form, some of the myths about GPR having no useful information in the top surface of a site started to fade. Interpreters realized that horizontal amplitude maps could adequately show small changes in near surface reflection signals that would go unnoticed when simply looking at the raw radargram profiles with their strong ground wave reflections. Small near surface features could usually never be seen in the profile mode of GPR since the ground wave would dominate and hide the small target signals. Signal processes of course could remove the ground wave and background signals to reveal small signals hidden in the ground wave. However, users of GPR even today often blindly always use these filtering techniques to the radargrams without regard to what they could be removing in the data as well. GPR technology has been applied to many subsurface archaeological investigation with great success to effectively map many archaeological structures that could be verified in excavations. Ancient burial pits, pit house floors, shell middens, rock walls, storage pits and a variety of structures were very conducive to GPR detection (Kvamme 2001; Conyers 2004; Goodman et al. 2009; Burks and Cook 2011; Dalan et al. 2011). Mapping Roman sites have proved to be one of the most straightforward applications that highlight the remote sensing capabilities of GPR. Subsurface foundations and walls from destroyed Roman buildings usually have strong reflection contrasts that can be easily detected and mapped by GPR (Nishimura and Goodman 2000; Neubauer et al. 2002; Conyers et al. 2002; Gaffney et al. 2004; Piro et al. 2003; Goodman et al. 2004; Seren et al. 2007; Campana and Piro 2009; Novo et al. 2009). GPR technology has advanced in the last two decades to make data collection faster, easier and with more recording resolution for single channel equipment. In recent days and with the improvement of multi-channel systems, GPR is finally reaching the capabilities that the original developers of this technology had hoped for years ago – for the radar systems to be able to collect high density coverage of a site. Multi-channel systems by several manufacturers provide hi-resolution survey systems that can be deployed quickly and with antenna channel spacing which approaches a quarter wavelength of the central frequencies of the radar wave traveling in the ground. Multi-channel systems provide an efficient method to survey the ground and these systems can provide what is properly referred to as “full resolution” imaging (Grasmueck et al. 2004, 2005; Novo et al. 2008). A 1/4 wavelength is an approximate guideline that is used to determine if the full resolution of the GPR equipment has been deployed on a site (Annan 2009). Multi-channel systems are not new to the GPR world, and some of the earliest systems were developed more than two decades ago primarily for defense and for road evaluation. The earlier equipment although conceptually developed and built failed to deliver good – full resolution imaging on the ground primarily because of   1 Introduction  3  the inability to get highly matched channels. Recently made equipment and system designs have adequately solved many antenna design challenges such as cross coupling issues (Daniels 2009). Several GPR arrays today now deliver reliable and consistent radar profiles between all the antennas. Some surveyors, realizing the need to collect GPR in a full resolution coverage of a sites but without the financial capability to deploy multi-channel equipment, have painstakingly acquired data from single channel equipment using very tight lines (Grasmueck et al. 2005; Novo et al. 2008). The authors believe that single channel systems which are primarily being used today might eventually be competing with multichannel system as costs for these systems become more affordable. In this book, a chapter is dedicated to multi-channel GPR. Discussion of the unique data processing requirements along with examples of multi-channel deployment on several important archaeological sites is presented. With the multi-channel chapter, contributions by Alex Novo from the University of Vigo (Spain) and Gianfranco Morelli at GeoAstier (Livorno, Italy) have helped to bring the writings to reflect the state-of-the-art in this growing field. The contents of this book are primarily directed to single channel systems which are still the more common equipment being used today. Most GPR data has a lot of scan density collected along the individual profiles but little data available between profiles – which is controlled by the profile spacing. Unique processes to construct images from single channel equipment, and which can accommodate the coarser line spacing that is normally employed in these surveys is developed in Chap. 4. Time slice generation using data binning and interpolation for GPR was first introduced by Goodman and Nishimura (1993). The concepts of data binning and interpolation and how to use regularly or irregularly sampled datasets to construct time slice images and pseudo 3D volumes are covered. Often what is seen in archaeological excavations is not ideally translated in the GPR record. Sometimes what is obviously seen and exposed in excavation is not observed in the GPR data. The contrary can be observed as well – some buried (electrical) contrasts invisible to the human eye might be clearly recorded and illuminated by GPR. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the geophysical method of GPR by first looking what it takes to build a simulator and examining all the basic components needed to do this. Understanding GPR via a simulator will help with understanding how buried structures in the ground are translated or not translated into the recorded radargrams. This section of the book covers how the electromagnetic model of the ground is described in simulator. The basic descriptions of microwave transmission into the ground and quantification of reflection, refraction, transmission and attenuation of radar waves are necessary to expedite our building of the simulator. Unfortunately this chapter is not about the development of the theory of electromagnetic propagation as this in its entirety could take a several volumes in itself. We are really forced to present a few essential equations that we must simply digest without developing their origin in order to continue with making our GPR simulator. In this chapter we shall “pre-apologize” as having to include this necessary medicine as the simulator needs these components to work. Examining GPR via building a simulator will nonetheless be useful to practitioners that   4  1 Introduction  want to comprehend why the resulting radar records look very different or in some cases very similar to the subsurface features. Understanding how GPR reflection profiles look across various simulated structures can help users of the equipment avoid interpretation pitfalls. In this chapter we provide many examples of model structures along with the resulting synthetic radargrams. The reader will immediately be able to see where discontinuities as well as similarities between various ground structures and (simulated) radargrams exist. We hope this section lays the groundwork for GPR users to better understand and to make better and more informed interpretations of the reflections observed in their radar profiles. This book provides essential discussion of radargram signal processing (RSP) along with the most commonly used radargram filters that may be needed in GPR subsurface imaging. A separate chapter is dedicated to basic radargram signal processing to detail these specialized filters. The entire field of signal processing of GPR radargrams in itself could also could also take up several books. The authors present those processes that we believe most non-technical users of the equipment will really need to know in order to make the most with their GPR data. Examples of radar data before and after processing are shown. Signposts are also illuminated in this section when certain filters may need to be implemented in order to precondition the radargrams prior to image construction. In addition, problems with “over” filtering are identified and hopefully the user can gain insight when and when not to apply a certain filter process. Once a set of raw or processed radargrams are available, 2d time slices and 3d volumes of GPR reflections can be constructed. The constructed time slice images may have unique noises in them that were not apparent in the individual radargrams. Image processing to remove navigation noises such as staggering which can be observed in the generated time slices, or amplitude noises between various surveyed blocks manifested as mosaic noise, are introduced using real data examples. Other problems seen in the subsurface images such as line noises or geologic trend noises that mask hidden features or noises related to equipment timezero drift, can be corrected and are also briefly addressed as well in Chap. 4. One section of the book is devoted to GPR imaging on sites with topography and the unique issues that arise in these surveyed datasets. The techniques of static corrections for topography are presented along with more developed discussions of solving for the tilt of the GPR antenna over sites with topography. This section is followed by the most advanced section on static correction which we introduce – vector imaging – where the pitch/yaw/tilt – e.g. the vector of the scans are used to project radargrams into their true spatial orientation. Examples of vector imaging on burial mounds as well as on application for projecting GPR radargrams from tunnel surveys are shown. Vector imaging will eventually become more commonplace as accelerometers and tilt meters become standard equipment on GPR antenna Recently a group run by Joe Boyce at McMaster University in Canada have outfitted their GPR with real time accelerometer data and their setup is shown in this chapter as well. One chapter is devoted to what the authors call overlay analysis (Goodman et al. 2006, 2009). The authors believe this is the most useful – single 2d display – of   1.1 Authors and Prologue  5  complicated 3d datasets that can be made available. The specialized analysis uses the relative-strongest-reflections recorded in a dataset, and describes a method on how to synthesize all these reflections into a single 2d map. The method is not overly complicated and the images from the overlay analysis construction often provide the most defining and useful single data display from a site. Because the authors believe that this imaging method is so important, and because it is not being widely practiced, a separate dedicated chapter on overlay analysis is provided. Several examples using real datasets from pit houses in North Dakota to applications on the Imperial Family Tombs in Miyazaki Prefecture Japan are shown. Several additional overlay analysis examples are presented in hopes of making a convincing argument to the readers of this chapter to try similar analysis to get the most out of their GPR data. Overlay analysis can help to find hidden structures in the data which are never contained or seen in just the discreet – single level – time slice datasets. GPR has found a secure home in the field of NDT – nondestructive testing. Historical buildings and monuments are coming under constant attack by the elements and measuring the integrity of these important structures is critical in developing preservation and restoration. GPR is a useful technology that can look inside historic structures to discover cracks, deterioration, and weathering of internal construction supports that are keeping these buildings together. As the authors have had limited experience in this important and growing field in archaeology and cultural preservation, several researchers have been invited to present their state-of-the-art contributions in GPR imaging on historical buildings in Chap. 7. In North America one of the most widely used applications of GPR is in the surveying of historic cemeteries for discovering unmarked graves. Lost or partially intact cemetery sites are coming under constant competition from nearby development projects which expand their land holdings further and further into unmarked regions. Often many cemeteries have also been neglected over the years or vandalized and finding unmarked graves is critical to preserving and identifying the boundaries of these burial grounds. In Chap. 8, generalized radargram features that can be seen over cemetery sites is examined first by looking at candidate grave structures and seeing the unique radar patterns that can be recorded. Graves with varying degrees of weathering, e.g. intact graves, graves without remains but simple backfilled pits, etc. are shown via simulation examples and with real data. Learning why reflection profiles look the way they do over grave sites can help to explain observables in the time slice image dataset.  1.1  Authors and Prologue  This book is not meant to have a complete discussion of the subject of GPR imaging and its application to archaeology. There have been numerous researchers that have made many contributions to this expanding field: Bernabini et al. (1992), Bevan and   6  1 Introduction  Kenyon (1975), Conyers (2004, 2006) and Conyers and Goodman (1997), Doolittle and Bellantoni (2010), Gaffney and Gator (Gaffney and Gater 2003), Kvamme (2006), Leckebush (2003, 2011) and Leckebush and Rychener (2005), Linford and Linford (2004), Malagodi et al. (1996a, b), Neubauer et al. (2002), Trinks et al. (2010), Nishimura et al. (2004), Vaughan (1986), Vickers and Dolphin (1975), Waters (2006, 2004) are among some of the more recognizable researchers that have all helped to advance the knowledge in the field of GPR application to archaeology. This book is really meant to be a somewhat “selfish” attempt to coalesce the life’s work of two lucky fellows who had the opportunity and support to get completely immersed with GPR in archaeology without having to struggle and be distracted by worrying about research funding. Dr. Salvatore Piro has been part of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (Institute of Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage, ITABC-CNR) which, from early 1980, was one of the first governmental institutions worldwide to recognize the importance of geophysics in archaeological investigations. Salvatore has helped to advance the use of GPR and other geophysical techniques through the ITABC and the Ground Remote Sensing Lab he has worked at and directed since the 1980s. From the inception of this lab in early 1980s till now, his research has involved the development of acquisition, elaboration and interpretation techniques for archaeological prospection employing magnetic, earth resistance and ground penetrating radar methods. His recent research interest includes acquisition and processing of integrated geophysical methods for near surface investigations. Dr. Dean Goodman had a unique opportunity to work at a small archaeological geophysics lab of the University of Miami Japan Division from 1989 to 2008. Dean had significant support from the city of Nakajima Machi, the museum at Saitobaru in Miyazaki, and the Nara National Cultural Properties Research Institute where he also was a guest researcher for many years. Since 2001, Dean had the tremendous fortune to be ‘adopted’ by the US Forest Service Heritage Program, run at that time by Dr. Kent Schneider who helped to encourage and foster continued growth of software development at the Geophysical Archaeometry Laboratory. Salvatore had the opportunity to meet Dean during the second International Conference on GPR in Rovaniemi, Finland in 1992 and that was the occasion to establish a true friendship and collaboration inside this particular field of GPR application. Both Salvatore and Dean have had the unique opportunity to work with GPR in archaeological surveys and both can remember the time of analog GPR with each having started with such equipment. From 1998, at the introduction and joint researchers with Yasushi Nishimura from the Nara National Cultural Research Institute, CNR, and the Geophysical Archaeometry Laboratory, Salvatore and Dean have worked on many joint projects together. Many of the case histories presented in this book are from joint surveys both have surveyed together through their organizations. We also realize that our expertise in a few areas was insufficient and therefore we have made use of a few works from outside researchers in an attempt at making this book more complete on GPR remote sensing in archaeology and worthy of   References  7  readership. In a few locations when outside assistance was significant at a site survey or study written about, the names of these researchers are identified on the titles of these sections. This book represents in part a documentation of some of the highlights of the authors life’s work that each have had for over 20 years working in the field GPR Archaeometry. Most of this book is dedicated to case histories from all around the world, but also involves the introduction of new GPR processing procedures that needed to be developed to in order solve various subsurface problems. New software to handle more complicated subsurface problems were developed and used in many of the case studies presented herein. We hope that this writing can be viewed in time as a reasonable attempt in describing the potential for GPR in remotely sensing subsurface archaeology. At the same time, we hope that the readers of this work can maintain some reservations about the capabilities of the method, but also help them to realize appropriate applications where GPR may be a useful tool in unearthing archaeology without digging.

Various factors including the innate design of the survey equipment and the complexity of electromagnetic propagation in the ground can disguise complex near surface earth structures recorded on GPR reflection profiles. A very useful way to understand the nature and content of GPR radargrams is to understand what components are needed to develop a basic simulator. The simulator would provide a means to predict radargrams made across candidate models of the ground and help to explain how buried target structures get translated into recorded reflection profiles. The simulator can show the limitations of this remote sensing method, but also highlight the capabilities of GPR and where this exploration tool and in what subsurface environments that it can and cannot function optimally. The main components required to build a simulator for GPR would include design elements for creating an electromagnetic model of the ground. The simulator has to incorporate the theory on how electromagnetic radar waves will propagate in the model created, and it must also account for the engineering design of the simulated GPR equipment that is used to estimate recorded reflections made over the model. The following basic list of items need to be defined and built into the simulator and include: Earth Model Reflection Transmission Refraction Attenuation Antenna Beam Antenna Pulse Raypaths Some of these components in the simulator we either have to define, such as the earth model, or things that we need to know about the basic propagation of radar waves, such as how they reflect, transmit or refract, as well as attenuate in ground. D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_2, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  11   12  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Other things required in the simulator include knowledge about the equipment being used such as the directional response of the antenna beam as well as the pulse shape of the burst of microwave energy transmitted into the ground. All of these components will have to be described or set and programmed into the simulator before a synthetic radargram can be generated across a model structure of the ground. Each one of these essential components used in the simulator is discussed in more detail and descriptions drawn to help understand the transmission of microwave into the ground and the final recording of the radar waves. The list above is by no means meant to be complete as the “true” propagation of radar waves predicted by any simulator is just an approximation of the real world propagation (Giannopoulos 2005, Powers and Olhoeft 1995). Predicting radargrams over model structures, as is common in geophysical forward modeling, can greatly assist in understanding the complex nature of GPR signals recorded on even the simplest of subsurface structures. Understanding the complex radar patterns can help interpreters in the diagnosis of GPR radargrams and from falling into interpretive pitfalls. Learning about the simulation of GPR will more than likely place breaks on nonchalant interpretations made about reflections observed on raw radargrams.  2.1  Earth Model  One way to consider the near surface ground is that it is comprised of capacitors and wires, where different materials and soils have different sized capacitors and wires (Fig. 2.1). The capacitor or dielectric relates to the ability of the ground to store charge. The larger the dielectric the more charge that can be stored in ground. If the ground can store charges while a microwave transmits through it, then dielectrics will act to impede the microwave from penetrating very quickly into the ground at depth since the ground is acting to store the microwave and charge the ground along the way. On the other hand, when a material or soil has weak or non-existent dielectric properties, there is essentially no impediment to the travel of the microwaves. Microwaves traveling through low dielectric material will travel faster, approaching the speed of light in a vacuum when the dielectric is 1. The velocity of microwaves for a material as a function of its dielectric and conductivity is given by (Cassidy, 2009): C vð f Þ ¼ qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2d e0 ð f Þmr 1þ 1þtan 2 where the loss tangent  (2.1)   2.1 Earth Model  13  Fig. 2.1 A schematic diagram indicating an idealized ground which is composed of varying dielectric material and of wires having varying conductivity 00  d¼ 0  sdc e þ 2pf e0  e0 ð f Þ  (2.2)  00  and e is the real dielectric, e is the complex dielectric, sdc the conductivity, f is the frequency, C is the speed of light, e0 is the permittivity of free space, and m is the magnetic permeability. This equation for the velocity of microwaves indicates that they are a function of frequency. In general, if the loss tangent is small, and the velocity of microwaves is not a strong function of frequency, which is generally the case for microwave in the range 10 MHz–1 GHz, then this equation reduces to a familiar form: C v ¼ pﬃﬃ e  (2.3)  The velocity of a material is inversely related to the square root of its dielectric in the simplest form. The dielectric of a vacuum is 1 (which is also close to the dielectric of air) – and the velocity of light in air is the speed of light. Interestingly, one of the slowest materials for microwaves to travel in is water, which has a dielectric of 81. Microwaves that travel through water have a velocity that is 1/9th the speed of microwaves in air. Most earth materials (see Table 2.1) have dielectrics that vary between 5 and 35. Conductivities of varying soil materials also have a wide dispersion since the conductivity drastically changes by any inclusion of water or moisture into the soil.   14  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Table 2.1 Typical (approximated) values of conductivity and real dielectric found for some materials (adapted after Daniels 1996, 2004; Ulriksen 1982). The values of velocity, wavelength and attenuation are based on a 400 MHz microwave. (Electrical properties are shown to be quite variable between dry and wet conditions.)  The first step in the model construction is to define all the electrical properties of the materials and boundaries that are to be included in the simulation. This essentially requires defining the dielectric and the conductivities for the different structural elements in the subsurface. These material properties are set through a digitized grid that also stores the slopes and lines of structural boundaries. Of course the real earth model can have infinitely variable dielectrics and conductivities located at all the locations in the ground and this is impossible to completely set. However, for many earth models with only several distinct structures, reasonable estimates of the homogenous elements in this model can be defined in a discrete and   2.2 Reflection  15  digitized grid. For the subsurface structures studied, digitizing the earth model around 1 cm or less can adequately be used for mapping the reflection/transmission of GPR microwaves for most of the mid-range antenna frequencies from 100 to 800 MHz used in archaeology.  2.2  Reflection  Once the model candidates are determined and boundaries drawn to describe the subsurface model structures, the next step is to program how microwaves will reflect off these features. The ratio of reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude, described by the reflection coefficient for microwaves (with parallel polarization) between a material 1 and material 2 is given by: R¼  Z2 cos y1   Z1 cos y2 Z2 cos y1 þ Z1 cos y2  (2.4)  (after Annan 2009) where the complex electromagnetic impedance Z is given by sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ jom Z¼ s þ joe  (2.5)  and y1 the angle of incidence and y2 the angle of refraction of the transmitted wave (discussed in a later section), and j the imaginary number. It is useful to understand the reflection equation for vertical incidence of the radar wave. The reflection of microwaves for vertical incidence is given by: R¼  Z2   Z1 Z2 þ Z1  (2.6)  Equation 2.6 is also sometimes written for the case when conductivity is negligible to pﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃ e1   e2 R ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃ e1 þ e2  (2.7)  Equation 2.7 states that the reflection strength is related to the difference between the square roots of the dielectric between the materials. This is an important descriptor of how much energy is reflected by radar waves off of subsurface objects. The amount of reflection is related to the difference between the electrical parameters, primarily the dielectric of the materials. If there is no contrast buried in the ground – there is no reflection! This equation also tells us that GPR does not generate unique reflection strengths. The method at best can measure the degree of electrical contrast that is present at the boundary between two materials where a reflection occurred. GPR cannot uniquely define a material simply based on the   16  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  strength of the reflection – GPR is not a “gold” finder per se, but better said a “contrast” finder. With Eqs. 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, the strength of the radar wave reflecting from any subsurface structures that are made in our model earth can easily be calculated. For an example of two materials where the conductivities are negligible and where the dielectrics are e1 ¼9 and e2 ¼16, about 1/7th of the initial amplitude would get reflected at the boundary. In another example, if one is considering the reflection from a buried metallic object (conductivity 10,000 mho/m for iron as an example) in contact with a soil (conductivity 0.01 mho/m), we must consider the conductivity in Eq. 2.7. In this case, the reflection field strength gives a value of 0.9999 or nearly all the microwave is reflected from the metal object! Another interesting observation that can be surmised from Eq. 2.7 is that the reflection amplitude can change sign depending on the which dielectric is larger or smaller. When the reflection amplitude is negative the wave will invert on reflection. These are commonly called phase reversals and are often discernible in many real situations. As the wave travels in the ground it may encounter many other subsurface features that it will need to reflect off of. The simulator software continually monitors the wave at each boundary as multiple reflections are made. The strength of the reflection as it is diminished by multiple reflections within the model earth are stored as the wave travels through the grid.  2.3  Transmission  The transmission of radar waves for parallel polarization at an interface between two materials is given by the equation T¼  2Z2 cos y1 Z2 cos y1 þ Z1 cos y2  (2.8)  For vertical incidence this equation reduces to: T¼  2Z2 Z2 þ Z1  (2.9)  In the case of a wave encountering a metal target on its path at normal incidence, the transmission into the boundary is nearly 0 since the impedance Z2 which is proportional to the inverse square root of the conductivity is close to 0 for large conductivity. The other way to look at the problem is that since nearly all the energy is reflected off the boundary of a metal object, then there is no transmission of any significant energy into the metal object. Thus GPR cannot look through metal – it can only see the top of metal!   2.4 Refraction  17  Fig. 2.2 The reflection and transmission of a microwave at a boundary where electrical contrast exists between two materials  In the case of negligible conductivity for both materials Eq. 2.9 can be reduced to the special case pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 e1 T ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ e1 þ e2  (2.10)  When the dielectrics of two materials are the same then there is no reflected wave and the transmitted wave is unity assuming the conductivities are also the same.  2.4  Refraction  The microwave that transmits across an anomalous structure will refract – e.g. change its direction. The new angle that the transmitted wave will refract to at a boundary is given by an ancient – archaeological formula – Snell’s Law: sin y1 v1 ¼ sin y2 v2  (2.11)  Examination of Snell’s Law indicates that the larger the contrast in velocity (or the electrical contrast) between two materials – the larger the change in the angle the refracted wave will have from its incident wave (Fig. 2.2). A good way to visualize refraction is to make an idealized earth model and a simple radar antenna where all the waves are radiating out in a cone from the antenna. The refraction of microwaves for a simplified earth model where just the dielectric is getting smaller with depth – e.g. the velocity is getting faster with depth – is shown in the top diagram of Fig. 2.3. Here, the transmitted waves are shown to be refracting away from the vertical-downward direction. Transmission into higher velocity media causes the refraction of the waves and makes the beam appear much broader with increasing depth. With the broadening beam, more of the ground off to the sides of the antenna is illuminated. In some of the models discussed the size of the refracted/transmitted GPR beam at a depth of 1 m might be as large as several meters.   18  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.3 Three idealized subsurface structures where the dielectric of the material is (a) increasing with depth (top diagram), (b) where the dielectric of the materials is decreasing with depth (middle diagram), and (c) a layered earth with random dielectric values. The top diagram shows the beam broadening and the middle diagram shows beam narrowing as the dielectric increases (velocity decreases with depth). The idealized earth model in bottom diagram shows a combination of varying dielectrics with low/high velocity layers. In this case, the beam can broaden or narrow across different boundaries   2.5 Attenuation  19  Fig. 2.4 An idealized directional response of a bow-tie antenna. The transmitted response has side lobes near 60 . The “bumpiness” is artificially generated to indicate that real antenna are rarely perfectly symmetric in the transmitted beam response. In our simulator we will assume for simplicity that the receiving antenna records equally in all directions and we are just considering differences in the transmit beam  The beams width can ultimately place an error bar of a similar magnitude on the location of the (raw-unprocessed) reflections recorded back to the antenna. In the case when the dielectric is increasing with depth – velocity getting slower deeper in the subsurface, the beam of the GPR antenna will be focused – refracted downward (Fig. 2.3 middle diagram). This is actually the desired effect one would always wish for in GPR surveying – to have a narrow beam transmitted into the ground with less illumination off to the sides of the antenna. Of course a real earth model will have a much more complicated refraction pattern where waves will refract downward and then change to refracting away from the vertical with multiple and varying combinations (bottom diagram in Fig. 2.3). The GPR transmitted beam in the ground in this instance can widen or get narrower at varying boundaries in the earth. The refraction of the radar waves is important since our simulator needs to trace the exact path each of the rays of energy emanating from the idealized antenna travel in order to see if the ultimate path gets reflected back to the antenna. (It should be noted that there is a critical angle – Brewster’s angle – after which no energy will be transmitted into the deeper material. Past the Brewster angle, evanescent waves exist (Annan 2009)).  2.5  Attenuation  In order to simulate microwaves propagation we also need to know how GPR waves will attenuate as they travel in the ground. The attenuation is primarily controlled by the conductivity. The higher the conductivity of the material, the faster the wave will dissipate into the ground. The formula to describe the attenuation rﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ i ﬃ 1 0hpﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ mE a¼o ð1 þ tan2 dÞ   1 2  (2.12)   20  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.5 An example of a damped sinusoidal response for varying frequencies and a comparison with an estimated real response of one 500 MHz antenna  is related to the loss tangent (shown in the Earth model section) of the material which is a combination of the dielectric and conductivity. Microwaves traveling through a material will exponentially decay as e a. The larger the attenuation factor the quicker the microwave pulse will dissipate in the material. Table 2.1 lists the attenuation of different materials provided for a nominal microwave frequency of 400 MHz. The attenuation factor is often listed as the decrement of a wave in traveling 1 m. For instance in the table for idealized air where there is no   2.6 Antenna Beam  21  Fig. 2.6 Examples of several different type of raypaths that can be recorded on a three layer earth. R, TRT, RRR, RRTRT, TRRRT, RR are possible energy paths that microwave energy can travel  conductivity, the attenuation in 1 m of travel is 0 – the microwave does not change or lose energy. For a clayey soil for example (dielectric ¼ 15, conductivity ¼ .05 mho/m), the attenuation of the wave will be 0.09 (exp( 2.42)) of the initial amplitude after traveling 1 m. The microwave pulse will be less than 10 % of initial amplitude. If the way travels another meter, the wave will be 0.0081 (09*.09) of its initial amplitude or less than 1 % of its original amplitude. Thus clayey soils highly attenuate microwaves. On the other hand, some completely (dry) clayey soils that have lower conductivities than that described in this example may not attenuate microwaves dramatically. Just a little inclusion of water however, dramatically changes the conductivity/attenuation of a material. Most materials are dramatically changed by the insertion of water and any increase will always make the material attenuate microwaves faster. In our simulator, the change in amplitude of the wave caused by conductive dissipation is monitored and integrated along the path of the wave. The initial wave can undergo extensive amplitude changers along the raypath caused by reflection/ transmission at model boundaries, but the wave will also be attenuated continuously within a homogenous material as it travels. Should the wave return to the receiving antenna, the final amplitude from reflection/transmission changes as well as from attenuation along the raypath will be recorded. Whether or not the final amplitude recorded is significant or not will be shown in the synthetic radargrams which will add up all the energies reflected back to the receiving antenna.  2.6  Antenna Beam  The refraction of radar waves is dependent upon the initial angles that are transmitted into the ground. The antenna beam – or directional response function – determines the amount of energy that is radiated in each direction from the antenna. All antennas normally radiate energy in a 3D cone of varying broad or narrow angles with complicated patterns of amplitude that vary in different azimuthal angles (Yarovoy et al. 2007; Daniels 2009). In archaeological applications the most widely used antenna is the bow-tie antenna which have a main lobe and   22  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.7 In this GPR simulation the reflection off of three different materials with varying dielectric contrast embedded the matrix soil Er ¼ 5 is shown. The first reflection has a dielectric Er ¼ 6 which is very close to the background soil and thus the reflection is weak since the contrast is small between the soils. In the middle soil Er ¼ 3 the reflection is larger since the contrast between the two materials is slightly larger. Note that the middle reflection pulse appears inverted w.r.t. the ground wave. The reflection off the third soil is largest since the dielectric Er ¼ 40 is much different than the background soil. RRR wave energy has a travel path in the ground, that initially reflects off an object, returns to the top air-ground surface and reflects there, then travels downward again and reflects a third time to be recorded back to the receiving antenna and is included. The multiple reflection RRR wave shows significant energy being returned to the antenna when the contrast is highest for the third material; and completely negligible for the first material which has low contrast with the surrounding soil. (Some range gain have been applied to the synthetic pulses). Direct multiples from the surface usually have twice the travel time of the primary reflecting energy  sidelobes. A typical radar pattern for parallel bowtie antennas can look something like that shown in Fig. 2.4: The sidelobes of typical bow-tie antenna are close to 60 off the vertical (Daniels 2009). This pattern shown is a simple 2D slice through the radar beam. The beam response perpendicular to the co-dipoles transmitter and receiver antenna is usually much narrower and the main beam is directed more vertical with lower transmission   2.6 Antenna Beam  23  Fig. 2.8 In this example the importance of conductivity on the reflected field strength is simulated. To see the effects of just conductivity, the dielectric of all the materials are kept constant and just the conductivity is allowed to vary. For the higher conductive material (0.5 mho/m) the reflection is much larger than materials which have conductivities closer to the background material. Conductivity contrasts – not just dielectric – controls the reflected/transmitted wave amplitudes. Multiple reflections from just conductive differences can also generate significant returned energies when the contrast between materials is high enough. (In the figure the RRR multiple wave reflections are indicated on the third material)  strengths off to the sides. We only consider the parallel direction of the antenna as that is the most common orientation used in archaeological surveying. It should be noted that broadside orientation of the antenna could affect detectability of structures since the beam is typically narrower and weaker (Leckebusch 2011). Since our simulator is a 2D simulator we will just be considering the 2D pattern of the antenna. For the simulations we are also ignoring unshielded effects of the antenna since there are in fact back lobe responses which become more prominent with lower frequency antenna. Unshielded antenna that radiate and receive over 360 can be implemented in borehole simulations, but for the sake of most GPR applications for archaeology our simulated antenna are assumed to be perfectly shielded as we design them and radiate over only a hemisphere in the ground. The radiation pattern is also altered by the electrical properties of the surface material and the height of the antenna above the ground (Annan 2009). The exact pattern of   24  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.9 Reflections and transmission partitioning at an interface dictate whether sufficient energy is available to detect features just below the interfaces. In this simulation, a copper box is buried in materials with conductivities ranging from 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 mho/m. The dielectric of all materials is kept constant at Er ¼ 12. In the first material, the contrast between the background and the soil is so large that most of the energy is reflected at the top interface – no measurable reflected energy is observed that gets transmitted across the boundary to detect the copper box. The multiple reflection at depth, the RRR wave is detected however. In the third material, most of the energy gets transmitted across the boundary so that the reflection from the copper box is strong. Just as the R wave is not seen since the contrast is negligible between the background material and the third material, the RRR wave would be essentially nonexistent in terms of signal strength. The middle model shows a transitional electrical contrast state for comparison. Here the reflection from the top of the second material and the reflection from the copper are detected although relatively weak. The conductivity which is responsible for the contrast in the materials is also playing a part in the attenuation as the wave travels. The higher the conductivity in the material the faster the wave will attenuate  any manufactured antenna is really difficult to know precisely. Slight infinitesimal changes in the antenna surfaces can generate different patterns between what are “identically” manufactured antennas. In our simulator however, we will assume that the transmitted energy will follow the typical GPR beam as shown in Fig. 2.4. We will also assume that the antenna receiver can record waves equally in all directions without loss of recording energy in any given direction. This functionality is idealized by the blue receiver response which is set to 1 in all directions for simplicity. In reality, it is difficult to independently measure the receiving response   2.6 Antenna Beam  25  Fig. 2.10 A classic simulation to help assist beginners with the GPR technology, is to see the impact of varying matrix materials on an identical round object that is buried at the same depth in two different dielectric materials. On the left hand side, the light green material has an Er ¼ 25 corresponding to a velocity of 6 cm/ns and the yellow material is Er ¼ 9 which has a faster velocity of 9 cm/ns. The net effect of surveying with broad beam antenna is to generate a recorded hyperbolic reflection from each of the buried circular objects. The hyperbolic reflection from the object buried in the slow material – takes overall longer travel times for the reflections to be recorded back to the receiving antenna the overall reflections. The reflections from the circular object in the faster material take less travel time to return to the receiver. The hyperbola shape and narrowness is a function of the velocity of the material the object is embedded in. With software one can fit a hyperbola to the observed hyperbolas and discover the velocity of the matrix material the round target is buried in. (The complete mathematical description of the GPR hyperbola is presented in the section for migration in Chap. 3)  separate from the transmission response since they are convolved together in the final recorded measurement. The antenna beam in the simulator is sampled at varying increments in order to send rays of energy into the ground at very small angles. In some of the simulations the density of rays along the beam can be sent into the ground at coarse 1 angular intervals or more. However, in some models because of the small scale structures to be imaged and the deeper depths to target structures, 1/10 of a degree intervals or even smaller are used to ensure that small scale structures buried deep in the ground are properly sampled and bombarded with rays from the simulator.   26  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.11 A square trench has a distinctive radar pattern. The RR wave for this model represents a double reflection that bounces off one side of the trench and the trench floor and is then recorded. Two apparent half hyperbolas can be seen in the center of the trench. One of the pitfalls to avoid making is to interpret these reflections as resulting from several pipes round objects located near the corners of the trench on each side. The reflections are simply from multiple RR waves that are recorded. In this example, the depth to the top of the square trench on the sides is the same height of the trench floor below ground. What this translates into is the R wave from the bottom of the trench arrives at the same time as an RRR wave which is recordable but has lower reflections. Interpreting the RRR wave energy and the R wave from the bottom of the trench as being another continuous reflecting layer with variable reflection strength would be an incorrect interpretation  2.7  Antenna Pulse  With the antenna beam described, the simulator next requires the shape of the impulses being sent out of the antenna to be defined. GPR antenna send out a burst of microwave energy along the beam front that has an impulse response which when idealized resembles damped or Ricker wavelet sinusoids (Fig. 2.5). The real response of pulse transmitted from the antenna may show reverberations for several nanoseconds or pulse widths. Ideally, engineers would like to generate a pulse that is so narrow that the pulse might look like a simple spike and have no radiation of energy except vertically downward. With the current ground coupled antennas used today, a sharp pulse with a short duration cannot be realistically achieved (Daniels 2009). A typical transmitted pulse estimated for one GPR antenna with a central frequency of 500 MHz antenna is shown. The frequency often refers to the central   2.7 Antenna Pulse  27  Fig. 2.12 A square trench with a pipe in it has a complicated radar pattern. The combination of RR and RRR waves that rick shays off the pipe or the walls of the trench and back off the pipe or the floors of the trench can produce many faint and measurable hyperbolic-like reflection legs. The half hyperbolic tails from the RR wave can give the false impression that other materials or pipes may be buried when in fact all the complicated recorded reflections are caused by multiples from the radar waves bouncing inside the trench. In sites where we have more homogenous structures and sharp boundaries, the above features can be seen in real recorded radargrams. However, as the boundaries are diffuse with less sharpness, the multiple reflections seen in the synthetic are less likely to be apparent  frequency band or the peak frequency of the antenna. The antenna usually have a wide band around the center frequency. The transmitted pulse can be estimated by measuring reflections from a perfect metallic object, however, this recorded response is just an estimate of the response. The recorded response is actually a combined response of the transmitted impulse which gets modified by the receiving antennas to give the final combined response. The receiving antenna may have directional recording responses which are not equal in all directions and not identical to the transmitter response. In most of our simulations shown in his section for introducing GPR we will assume a simple damped sinusoidal response for the transmitted pulse coming out of our antenna, realizing that the true shape of transmitted pulse for any given antenna may not be so ideally designed. For some simulations in later sections where comparisons with real radargrams are modeled, estimated responses of the true transmitted response are employed.   28  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.13 A V-trench has a very distinct reflection pattern. The RR wave in this structure can generate a rounded reflection at the apparent center of the trench. Interpreters will often mistake this RR reflections as representing a pipe being located in the center of the trench. Another common interpretation pitfall is the improper identification of direct reflections legs on each side of the trench. The observed reflections from the R wave on each side of the trench center are actually coming from the opposite sides of the trench, e.g. energy that is recorded from the right side of the trench is only detected when the antenna is on the left side of the trench, and viceversa. Another interesting reflection is the triple RRR wave which for a V-trench model can have a flat reflection multiple located near the apparent bottom of the trench (in this example near 22 ns). The actually pattern that is recorded from a V-trench is very sensitive to the depth of the trench as well as the narrowness. For narrower V-trench the RR reflection may not be recorded or will not generate a pseudo hyperbolic reflection in the center (see Goodman 1994)  2.8  Raypaths  Once the impulse response function is defined for the ground probing antenna, the next step is to determine what energy paths the transmitted wave through the model might take. Our simulator might be likened to a glorified “pinball machine” where we send in a ball into the game area with a certain speed and maybe angle, not knowing where the ultimate path of the pinball might travel. The same with the GPR model, rays are sent into the model at regular spaced intervals emanating from the antenna. Some of the rays will return and get recorded – where others will dissipate and travel to areas where they will never be recorded or heard from again. Examination of the model can usually tell us which are the primary energy paths. For instance a model with several layers, we can expect energy to travel similar to some of the paths shown in Fig. 2.6. Waves that reflect are defined as R and waves   2.8 Raypaths  29  Fig. 2.14 A semi-circular trench extending to a depth of 1 m and with 1.6 m diameter can generate a reflection which is concave downward. This radar pattern is completely opposite of what one might expect. For the circular trench buried at deeper depths, the concave pattern will almost approach the look of a perfect hyperbola which can often mistakenly be interpreted as the reflection pattern due to a buried cylindrical object! The focusing of returned energy is dependent on the shape of the trench surface. In this case, a circular trench is modeled. A specially designed elliptical trench can wholly reverse the above observations – and shapes similar to what one might expect -such as a depression or concave up reflection can get recorded. The focusing or defocusing of GPR waves is very sensitive to small changes in the profile of the reflecting surface. The learning point here is that the shapes recorded on raw radargrams may have the complete opposite structure in the ground and the interpreter must be careful in translating what they observe to what they attribute the shape of candidate reflecting structure is  that transmit, reflect, and then transmit through a material to get recorded are defined as TRT for example. Waves that undergo multiple reflections, such as a wave that exits the antenna, reflects at depth, then rises to the surface and reflects off the air-ground interface, then goes back into the ground and reflects again before getting recorded is referred to as a RRR wave. A wave defined as an RR wave for instance, in a plane layer model will never return to the recording antenna and can be ignored. However, if there is a corner in the model like that shown on the bottom right diagram in Fig. 2.6 is present, then a RR wave traveling back to the receiving antenna is quite possible. There are an infinite number of possible trajectories and raypaths a wave might take, but usually only a few of the raypaths dominate the recorded energy coming back to the antenna.   30  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.15 To detect subsurface objects it is not just sufficient enough to have strong electrical contrast of the object with the surrounding soils to record reflections. The shape of the target is just as important. In this example a buried triangle with sharp edges causes the recording of reflections nearly 2 m from the actual location where it is buried. Directly above the triangle no reflected energy is recorded since a perfectly sharp edge of the triangle is modeled and does not have any significant flat surface that is oriented towards the antenna to send any rays back to the antenna. The back leg of the triangle does not reflect any energy back to the ground surface till at least the 4 m range. At larger ranges the right side of the triangle could reflect energy back to the direction of the antenna since the side is a few degrees less than vertical. However, the extra few meters for this geometry to become evident could also mean the wave will have attenuated by then, in addition to the travel time being outside the desired depth window chosen. The net effect is that no energy is recorded from the right side of the triangle for this simulation  Each time the ray reflects at some boundary, the amount of energy reflected is monitored for that ray (using Eq. 2.4). The attenuation as the ray travels is also continually updated as the ray travels through cells in the digitized grid (using Eq. 2.12). If the ray is required to undergo a transmission across a boundary, the amount of energy in the transmitted wave can be calculated (using Eq. 2.8) as well as the new angle of refraction that it will travel at in the new material (is found from Snell’s law – Eq. 2.11). The transmitted wave energy is continually monitored for the ray as well as the attenuation in the new material that the ray is traveling in. Should the ray make it back to the receiving antenna, the final energy in the recorded pulse is added up with all the other rays that are recorded. Many of the rays may arrive at different times and all will usually have different amplitude and different signs – +/  depending on whether the rays reflected off faster velocity   2.8 Raypaths  31  Fig. 2.16 The perfect triangle simulation shown previously indicates that no energy is recorded directly above the triangle since the super sharp edges have no flat or rounded portions too reflect any energy back to the receiving antenna. However, in the case when an edge is slightly rounded, then significant energy can be recorded from the top of the triangle. In this example an imperfection on the top of the triangle is modeled as a small semi-circle 2 cm in diameter to simulate a rounded edge. This small rounded edge can cause significant energy to be reflected back to the receiving antenna. This model explains why one component of Stealthy technology is to build outside structures with flat surfaces and to connect the surfaces so that the edges are as sharp as possible – which limits the radar returns and to prevent detection  targets along the travel path. Each of these small impulses arriving back to the receiving antenna from the multitude of different raypaths are convolved with the impulse shape of the transmitted antenna to generate a synthetic radargram for the model. Convolution is a mathematical process for simply multiplying the final recorded reflection/transmitted/attenuated response with the impulse response function of the antenna, and then adding up all these contributions for all the different rays recorded into a single and final – synthetic pulse. The major components in the simulator have been described. A program called GPRSIM Ground Penetrating Radar Simulation Software (Goodman et al. 2009; Goodman 1994) contains all the elements for performing basic GPR modeling. The software fundamentally uses ray tracing through user drawn models and does all the calculations to predict the reflected/transmitted/attenuated/refracted radar waves returning back to the simulated antenna. The software allows for customized designs of the GPR equipment such as antenna impulse response and directional   32  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.17 Significant velocity changes between different materials can alter the shapes of radar structures from the “real” buried structures. In this example soil1 (Er ¼ 7, velocity 11.3 cm/ns) and soil2 (Er ¼ 36, velocity 5.1 cm/ns) have a velocity contrast of 6.2 cm/ns., with soil2 being much slower. The total travel time for a ray to reflect off the bottom layer takes progressively less time on the right side of the model then on the left side of the model. The reason being is that on the left side of the model soil1 is thinner and soil2 which is much slower in microwave velocity is thicker – causing the overall travel time to the bottom layer to take much more time. On the right side of the model, the faster material soil1 is thicker and there is less of the slower layer soil2 that the microwave must travel through. The travel time here is thus much faster for the TRT wave which reflects off the flat bottom layer. The net effect is to cause an upward warping of the flat layer on the right hand side of the model since overall faster materials exists here. This effect is referred to as a “velocity pull-up” in seismology. Flat reflectors at depth may appear as not being recorded at equal times due to possible strong velocity contrasts and variable layer thicknesses of the highly contrasted soils  beam response functions to be incorporated into the program and tailored specifically for different kinds of radar systems. Structural boundaries in the software are stored as splines, lines or the exact geometry of the feature. Bi-section method is used to further break down discovered cells with interfaces and find the exact reflection point of traveling rays. Even though a model might be digitized at 1 cm, further accuracy on the point of intersection in a grid cell is refined with bisectioning. In the simulation display the travel times of different raypaths are given as a separate graph from the synthetic radargram. The travel time plot is useful in showing the type of raypath recorded and the time that that a ray arrived back to the antenna. Although a ray may be recorded and identified on the travel time plot,   2.8 Raypaths  33  Fig. 2.18 An effect in GPR imaging that is rarely talked about but is very common in seismological studies are shadow zones. For certain subsurface structures with varying material velocities, GPR radar waves can refract in such a way that some areas of the subsurface are never sampled  Fig. 2.19 Radargrams from pit dwellings often have recorded patterns which look closely like the real structures. In this example, a pit dwelling that has some structural materials embedded in the floor including pottery and a posthole is simulated. Differentiation of these smaller scale materials from the larger scale feature can sometimes be measured and defined on occasion in the field data, but more often than not these smaller features are not unequivocally interpretable. The recorded reflections can show several layers which may represent compacted floors and the reflections from the floor bottoms. Several multiples may also be apparent depending on the electrical contrasts between the soil materials. In general though, the large depression like feature indicative of a pit dwelling, can look very similar to the real structures buried in ground   34  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  Fig. 2.20 A Japanese subterranean burial chamber (chikashiki) synthetic radargram is compared with a real radargram. In this burial construction design from the Kofun period (300–700 AD) a shaft was dug and a chamber excavated in hard-packed volcanic soils and is typical of structures found at the Saitobaru National Burial Mounds in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The intact void chamber is recognized by a strong signal recorded from the roof. A small stone door might also be placed at the entrance after which the vertical shaft is backfilled with soil. Reflections from the shaft can often help to locate these features when the void chamber has collapsed and strong void reflections are no longer recorded from the main chamber structure. An example of a real radargram collected across the Sakamoto no Ue site in Saitobaru is shown. The reverberations recorded from the burial shaft and from the ceiling of the chikashiki chamber can be seen in the real radargram. In some instances, the rock door can be attempted to be modeled. From observations at similar sites it was found that multiple reflections between the shaft and chamber ceiling could produce strong reflections in the location where one would predict the stone door would be. The multiples could be falsely identified as resulting from a stone door (Edwards et al. 2000)   2.8 Raypaths  35  Fig. 2.21 In this example, a comparison of a real recorded radargram (bottom diagram) is compared with a simulated radargram. The model is a thin pipe buried in soil that is completely filled with water. As is often measured in real radargrams, several reflections that bounce from the bottom of the water filled pipe can be seen. The TRT wave and a wave that makes three reflections within the pipe, the TRRRT wave, are clearly recorded within the real radargram and also seen in the synthetic. The thickness of the pipe can also be estimated based on the time difference between the bounces if the dielectric of the internal fluid is known, e.g. pipe thickness ¼ v dt2 , where dt is the time difference between the direct R and TRT wave that bounces off the bottom of the pipe. The site was a known location with a filled water pipe present (Courtesy of David Taylor, Spectrum Geophysics)  whether or not it is a significant component is manifested in the synthetic radargram; which has the returned amplitude convolved with the impulse response of the antenna. The best way to see the net effects how GPR looks across structures, is to start out with simple features to see how the ground targets get translated and altered and eventually presented in the form of a raw radargram. Also, it is useful to look at   36  2 Understanding GPR via a Simulator  models with identical target features and shapes but that differ only by the electrical materials and to see how these changes can impact the recorded radar patterns. In Figure 2.7–2.21 examples of simulations across various models are shown. The simulations can help interpreters of radargrams to better understand the basic elements of GPR propagation, but to also comprehend why subsurface features do not translate directly to similar – recognizable structures on the raw radargrams. Comparisons with real recorded radargrams will be shown in several other chapters in this book including the chapter on historic cemeteries in North America and also a comparison with GPR across historic bridges in Spain. In addition, the use of signal processing on the synthetic radargrams to see how well certain filters operate will be shown in Chap. 3.

Radargram signal processing (RSP) involves using specialized filters to enhance and adjust the digitized reflections, as well as to remove noises contained in the raw recorded radar pulses. RSP can be applied to the radar pulses prior to constructing images from the radargrams. What signal processes are needed will depend on a variety of factors observed in the raw data. There are a variety of RSP that are essential and some are only used if certain noises are found to exist in the data. The basic RSP often used in GPR surveys are discussed: Post processing gain Bandpass filtering Background removal Migration Hilbert transform Deconvolution Resampling Smoothing/Stacking  3.1  Post Processing Gain  Most raw field data collected with GPR requires some post processing gain to be able to visualize the radar pulses. Most GPR manufacturers today record un-gained radargrams without any filters engaged, recording just the native raw field pulses. A few manufacturers allow the user to record gain into the raw field data as well as to apply filters. All data recorded without gaining in the field will require post processing gain. Even for field data where the manufacturer allows for gains to be recorded in the raw field data, some post processing gain adjustment is usually required because of the lack of some GPR systems to provide for adequate gain D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_3, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  37   38  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.1 A radargram that was recorded with a resolution of 16 bits is shown without any gain applied (top diagram). Range gain with depth is applied to amplify the signal (bottom diagram). The range gain starts a few nanoseconds after the ground wave reflection is recorded  controls. Shown in Fig. 3.1 is a 16 bit un-gained radargram where the signals are recorded from 32,768 to +32,767. Graphically, the raw pulses can show no visible reflections at deeper depths, giving the appearance of 0 signal here. There is in fact plenty of information on subsurface reflections which requires amplifications being added to the radargrams before these pulses can be visualized on the computer screen. Shown in the bottom of Fig. 3.1 is the same radargram with range gain applied. The range gain can be exponentially or linearly increased with depth in order to amplify the deeper – later arriving radar reflections. Unique gain curves can also be applied that can taper off with depth depending on the attenuation of the recorded signals. If there is less attenuation or the time window of the survey is shallow enough for the given antenna frequency, the radar pulse might be adequately gained by constant gain curves below the initial ground wave. An example of a radargram with a customized post-processing range gain to account for a inadequately gained raw field radargram is shown in Fig. 3.2. Noise in the radargram signal is also unfortunately amplified during post processing gaining of the raw radar scans. Some GPR manufacturers do not record the field radargrams with what are called frequency bandpass filters discussed in the next section. If this is the case, then the signal that is amplified may start to “float” away from the 0 line as low frequency noise is amplified. This can be partly seen in the amplified pulse seen in Fig. 3.2 and much more strongly in the radargram shown in Fig. 3.3. The pulse starts to move away from the 0 line deeper along the radar scan. This is low frequency DC-drift noise. The removal of this low frequency noise can   3.1 Post Processing Gain  39  Fig. 3.2 Differential gain added to a radargram (bottom diagram) that was initially recorded with less than optimum range gain in the raw field data (top diagram). A small component of DC drift was removed using a moving average with a filter length of 52 samples subtracted along the pulse  Fig. 3.3 A raw radargram is amplified to gain up the pulses, also amplifying low frequency DC noise (and high frequency noise). Removal of the low frequency noise is eliminated with a moving average of a designated window length being subtracted from each point along the pulse  be adjusted for in several ways. One simple process uses a windowed moving average along the pulse that is subtracted from the center at each point along the pulse. The length of the moving average can be somewhere in the neighborhood of 3–5 pulse lengths as a minimum length or longer. In the example in Figs. 3.2 and 3.3,   40  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  1/10th the scan digitization was used as the windowed length to compute the average value of the pulse that is subtracted from the center of the filter. The net effect of this filter is to remove the DC drift very effectively and shift the signal back to the 0 line. Removal of the DC-drift as well as high frequency noise can also be done very eloquently using bandpass filtering introduced in the next section.  3.2  Bandpass Filtering  Bandpass filtering is a process to remove unwanted frequencies in the raw radargrams. Bandpass filtering requires that radargram pulses first be converted to the spectral domain using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) (Daniels 1996; Malagodi et al. 1996). All recorded signals can be decomposed into a combination of individual pure frequencies which have different amplitudes and phases. FFTs are used to calculate the amplitudes and phase contained at each frequency that makes up the radar pulses. The combination of the amplitudes at different frequencies and the phase that those frequency components arrive at the receiving antenna defines the unique radar signals that get recorded. Although manufacturers often list transmit antennas as a single frequency most GPR antenna emit energy over a large band of frequencies. The central frequency of this band where the peak energy is transmitting from the antenna is often reported by the manufacturers as the antenna frequency. In bandpass filtering the amplitudes at different frequencies can be reduced or filtered out entirely by first decomposing the recorded radar signals using FFTs into their amplitude and phase at each frequency. With the signals decomposed into their spectral components, the amplitudes of different frequencies can be adjusted – much like the equalizer on a stereo music receiver – by simply suppressing or enhancing the desired frequencies. Once the filter is set to remove or reduce the desired frequency components, an inverse FFT is run to return the filtered spectra to time domain radar signals. Several examples of bandpass filtering to show different kinds of noise removal in raw data is presented. In Fig. 3.4 a radargram that has significant low frequency noise is shown. The low frequency noise exhibited in this data is indicated by the raw pulses that lose their grounding and have significant DC drift from the 0 line. The power spectra plot shows the amplitudes of the different frequencies. Low frequency noise below 100 MHz is seen and this is responsible for the signal being shifted away from the 0 line. The shifted signals in this example are not all to the positive or negative side of 0 but oscillate on each side of the 0 line. The manifestation of this noise in the scan plot of gray tones shows shifting between light and dark grays as the signal bounces on each side of the 0 line between adjacent scans. Using a bandpass of all the frequencies above 137 MHz and below 1,219 MHz the radar pulses can be filtered and shown for one scan on the right side of Fig. 3.4. The bandpass filtered pulse can be seen to be brought back to the 0 line as the low frequency noise components (and high frequencies) are suppressed. The complete bandpass processing on this entire radargram can be seen in the bottom of Fig. 3.4. The removal of the low end frequencies for this radargram shows bandpass filtering   3.2 Bandpass Filtering  41  Fig. 3.4 A radargram with severe low frequency noise is identified on a power spectra plot (top diagram). Removal of DC drift and high frequency noise are filtered out of the raw radargram using bandpass filtering (bottom diagram). The bandpassed radargram has frequencies below 137 MHz and above 1,219 MHz filtered out   42  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  can significantly clean up the radargrams with DC drift problems. (It should be noted that the bandpass curves used are not straight cutoffs but have some tapering of spectral gains to reduce ringing in the inverse FFT signals).  3.2.1  Notch Filters  Radio transmission noises or noises at a discreet set of frequencies can also infiltrate the recorded GPR radargrams. Shown in Fig. 3.5 is an example of transmission noises recorded on a radargram. The frequency spectra plot is useful to identify the isolated frequency band that this noise occupies. For this particular data, the low frequency noise band is well defined and situated near 50 MHz as identified in the spectra plot. The noise at this frequency is in the band defined as low frequency VHF noise and could be related to radio or ham radio transmissions. Using a bandpass filter which excludes all the frequencies below 80 MHz, the 50 MHz is transmission noise components are effectively removed. Not all frequency bandpass filters necessarily must cut off the low frequencies and the high frequencies. Notch filters, filters where only a set of well defined frequencies are removed from the GPR radargram pulses can be implemented. A notch bandpass filter is designed to only remove the spike in spectral noise at the desired frequencies. This filter is effective in removing the noises at the same time being able to preserve features in the radargram that may have contributions from frequencies outside the discrete band that is removed. An example on a radargram also having 50 MHz very low VHF noise and notched frequency filtered is shown in Fig. 3.6.  3.2.2  Low Frequency GPR and Bandpass Filtering  Some very low frequency GPR systems are used to record reflections several tens of meters below the ground surface. These antennas can often be used to map geologic features. The apertures of these large antennas can be 3–5 m in length. Low frequency antenna often are unshielded, causing above ground reflections to also infiltrate the data. Bandpass filtering is essential to remove the low frequency components which dominate these radargrams. Shown in Fig. 3.7 is a bandpass filtered radargram compared with the original raw radargram. The bandpass filter was applied between 3 and 32 MHz. For this antenna with a central frequency near 10 MHz antenna, frequencies above 32 MHz recorded by the antenna can be considered to be high frequency noise and removed in the bandpass process. The “high” frequency noise can be seen on the bottom of the raw radargram and appears as a (blue) fuzz in the image. The noise can also be clearly identified on the bottom of the range in the one raw unfiltered radar scan shown. The time window of 1,900 ns indicates that that this site was surveyed somewhere to a depth of between 60 and 80 m.   3.3 Spectral Whitening  43  Fig. 3.5 Example of (transmission) noises recorded on a raw radargram. Using a defined bandpass filter to exclude the low frequencies below 80 MHz, the noise can be effectively processed out  3.3  Spectral Whitening  A variation on bandpass filtering is spectral whitening. In this RSP the radargram pulses are converted to the spectral domain using the FFT. After the FFT the magnitudes of all the spectral frequencies are set to 1. This involves normalizing the real and imaginary spectral amplitudes (such that the square root of the squared   44  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.6 A notch bandpass frequency filter is shown which can effectively remove only those desired noise components present near 50 MHz from the raw radargram pulses  real part plus the squared imaginary part of the spectral frequency is unity). Spectral whitening on the inverse FFT can also be simultaneously implemented to eliminate the lower and higher frequencies using some bandpass settings. Spectral whitening has the ability to balance singles and create more evenly gained pulses. The subsurface features in the pulses and the radargrams are primarily formed by phase changes and not changes in the gain between the frequencies. An example of spectral whitening on the same radargrams is shown in bottom diagram of   3.3 Spectral Whitening  45  Fig. 3.7 An example of a raw and bandpass filtered radargrams for a very low frequency antenna (10 MHz)  Fig. 3.8. In this RSP one can see areas in the radargram which were previously lower in amplitude have higher gain and smaller scale features can be seen. Low frequency DC drift has been removed as well as the high frequency noises. Spectral whitening is a valuable signal process to generate balanced radargrams. This is particularly useful for multi-channel radargram processing when different antennas in the   46  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.8 Example of a raw, background filtered, bandpass filtered, and a spectral whitened radargram  system have different frequency responses. Signal balancing prior to making subsurface images is critical with these equipment.  3.4  Background Removal  GPR radargrams often have a constant noise infiltrating the recording of raw pulses. The noise manifests itself as bands of constant horizontal reflections across the radargrams. To remove the horizontal bands found in raw radargrams, one of the most popular filter processes is to calculate the average pulse across the entire radargram and then subtract this average pulse from each individually recorded pulse (Bernabini et al. 1992; Malagodi et al. 1996). The motivation for applying this filter is that it can help to illuminate just changes in the pulse that is different from the average pulse across the profile. An example of applying background filtering to a   3.4 Background Removal  47  Fig. 3.9 An example of some phantom reflections that can result from background filtering is shown. In this case, a strong linear like reflection anomaly existing along the major portion of the original profile (top), influences the average scan calculation. The background filtering results in a strong inverse reflection shown at two highlighted regions (since the average scan is subtracted) appearing in regions that were originally weaker in reflection energy  radargram with horizontal banding noise is shown in Fig. 3.9. One of the drawbacks of background filters are that they can “accidentally” remove linear features which are parallel to the profile track. If the trend of subsurface targets are at angles to the profile lines than the background filter can be implemented without too much worry. Background filters can also create phantom reflection anomalies. In the case when some partial linear reflections are recorded that comprise a major portion of a profile, subtracting the average scan can put strong reflections into these shorter areas that were initially weak. Shown in Fig. 3.9 is an example of phantom reflections caused by strong reflections in the center of the radargram, which are not continuous. Subtracting the average scan from this radargram causes several apparent areas where stronger reflections are now mapped, but were not originally seen in the raw unfiltered data. The background filter does do a good job on the removing continuous linear banding noises seen on the bottom ranges of the radargram however. In the case when subsurface features are parallel to the profile lines, the background filter should be derived from the entire site average and not just line-by-line as is the typical implementation. Multi-channel datasets can also have total channel averages computed individually as well to be used in implementing background filtering for these kinds of datasets. Having the average scan across the entire site be calculated from all the collected radargrams will ensure that those few lines with parallel linear features will not be filtered out. As long as enough lines across varied   48  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.10 Example of horizontal banding noises (top radargram) and the result of implementing background filtering (bottom radargram)  structures are recorded, the few lines with just linear features will not overweight the average. In this instance, background filters calculated across the entire grid can be used effectively without potentially removing isolated linear reflections. The order of applying background filters in the event that they are to be implemented is usually not critical. Shown in Fig. 3.8 in the second diagram is the background filter being applied first to a completely raw radargram where no bandpass filtering (or spectral whitening) has been implemented. The horizontal bands, which are more “disguised” here since there are vertical bands caused by DC drift are still effectively removed from the radargram before bandpass filtering. In Fig. 3.10, bandpass filtering was first applied, followed by background removal. The reason that background filtering can usually be implemented in a different order without any significant differences is that even though the DC drift is severe in the radargram, this noise does not affect the calculation of the average scan across the radargram. The DC drift – although changing dramatically between adjacent scans – is quickly averaged out to zero as the scans are summed to calculate the average scan that is subtracted from all scans.  3.5  Migration  Most GPR antenna send out a broad beam of microwave energy into the ground. The net effect of having a broad beam in the ground is to cause hyperbolic reflections being recorded from round objects in the ground (Fig. 3.11). Objects that are not directly beneath the antenna get recorded as microwaves are sent over a broad range of angles. The travel times however, from objects that are recorded off   3.5 Migration  49  Fig. 3.11 Depiction of a hyperbola recorded from a buried cylindrical object  to the side of an antenna take progressively longer travel times the further they are from being directly beneath the antenna. The net effect for buried point objects is to create a hyperbolic reflection pattern. We saw the hyperbola in the simulation in Fig. 2.11 where two different hyperbola were recorded, one of the hyperbola was broader and one was narrower. The shape of the hyperbola is given by the equation of the travel time from a buried object as a function of the distance to the antenna and is given by: pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 x2 þ z2 T¼ v  (3.1)  where T ¼ the two-way travel time x ¼ the horizontal distance to the subsurface object z ¼ the depth to the subsurface object v ¼ the microwave velocity in the ground The shape of a graph of T versus x describes a hyperbola which we can fit and match onto a hyperbola recorded on a radargram to determine an estimate of the velocity. When microwave velocities in the ground are very fast the hyperbolic reflections are very broad and wide; conversely, when the velocity is very slow, the hyperbola is very narrow. Migration is a signal process which will collapse hyperbolic reflections into point source reflections by adding up all the energy along hyperbolas across the radargram, and placing this energy at the apex of the hyperbola. This migration process makes use of the fact that the phase of the pulse when the hyperbola is not directly on top on the hyperbola will tend to destructively interfere with other reflections pulses recorded along the hyperbola. When the hyperbola is directly matched to the observed hyperbola, the migration process of adding all the energy along the hyperbola will be strong because the pulses along the hyperbola are all in phase. Migration collapses hyperbolas, but also reorients reflecting surfaces and properly positions them to their true position (Chun and Jacewitz 1981). (Various kinds of migration processes in the time domain such as Kirchoff migration and in   50  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  frequency domain using FK migration can be implemented but in most instances give reasonably similar results.) One of the drawbacks of migration is that often the complete velocity field is not known across the site so migration processing may generate pseudo data components and artifacts in areas where no reflection energy was originally recorded. Also, improper matching of the in situ velocity can create pseudo “reflections” in the radargrams. What are known as “smiley up” reflections are caused by migrating a radargram with a higher velocity then actually exists at the radargram profile location. Migrating a radargram with a velocity that is lower than the actual velocity material will create smiley down reflections. These effects are shown in Fig. 3.12 where a radargram that is migrated with too high of a velocity and a velocity that is too low. If one examines the hyperbola when the velocity is too high for instance when it is placed on top of an observed radargram hyperbola, one can see that at off center locations, that the hyperbola intersects the hyperbola of the pulse at just one location. Essentially, this results in mapping that part of the pulse to the apex of the hyperbola, resulting in a smiley up reflections as well as generating pseudo ghost reflections above the actual location of the recorded hyperbolic reflection. Similarly, the lower velocity migration will produce smiley down reflections at off axis locations from the observed hyperbola (third diagram Fig. 3.12). Using the correct migrating velocity, the hyperbolic reflections are collapsed closely into point source reflections (bottom diagram Fig. 3.12). However, even with the correct velocity, some pseudo ghost reflections can result from the migration process. Often the ghost reflections are faint (as seen near the top surface on the fourth radargram in Fig. 3.12). To reduce the influence of the migration process near the shallow zone of the radargram, the filter process can be limited to recorded samples below the ground surface wave (fifth radargram in Fig. 3.12). This can be important in making time slice images and getting reliable results from shallow time slice maps from processed radargrams. It might be useful to also examine migration on a “perfect” radargram using a simulation from a known structure to see how well the process can “recreate” the real structural boundaries responsible for the recorded reflections. O’Neill et al. (2004) has done similar studies to look at the effectiveness of migration on simulated radargrams. Shown in Fig. 3.13 are the results from migrating a v-trench simulation (shown in Fig. 2.3). The v-trench simulation when migrated shows the subsurface structure much more accurately then the raw (simulated) radargram. Some ghost reflections can be seen at the near surface, but these can be suppressed by starting the migration process some number of samples below the ground surface. In this example, the exact velocity is known, however, migrating at an incorrect velocity can also produce different kinds of results which do not emulate the actual structure (O’Neill et al. 2004). (The exact velocity is also detected closely by matching and fitting a hyperbola to the RR reflection leg shown in the GPR simulation chapter in Fig. 2.3). Another useful test to measure the capability of migration is the buried triangle simulation. In this simulation the flat edges do not return microwave energy directly below the antenna but off to the side. In the migration we set the velocity to the   3.5 Migration  51  Fig. 3.12 Examples of migration when the velocity is too low (second diagram), too high (third diagram) and just right (fourth diagram). Often, the migration process can also be applied only on the reflections below the ground wave reflection (fifth diagram) to reduce ghost reflections near the surface (seen on the upper regions of the fourth diagram)  known velocity in the model. (It should be noted if one used the velocity determined from the portion of the recorded reflection leg observed from the triangle, the velocity would be overestimated significantly). The migration projects energy   52  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.13 Migration performed on a simulated radargram made on a v-trench is shown. The migration process can effectively reorient reflections in this particular simulation to achieve a reflection pattern that more closely represents the subsurface feature  back to the real location of the triangle in the ground. However, the reflection energy measured off to the side, is still left in the image and is not destructively diminished very much by adding up the pulses along the hyperbola migrator. The energy moved to the real location is also only from the left side of the triangle and not the central position. Energy from the reflecting left side surface is just recovered and no information on the right side of the triangle is discovered, since no energy was ever recorded here (Fig. 3.14).   3.6 Hilbert Transform  53  Fig. 3.14 Example of the migration process on the buried triangle simulation. In this example energy is re-oriented to the location of the real location of the triangle, however, the original reflections recorded to the side of the triangle are not completely “migrated” out of the processed radargrams. It should be noted that the energy that is mapped back to the location of the triangle is just the left side of the triangle and not the central position  3.6  Hilbert Transform  Another signal process often applied to radargrams is to show the envelope of the radar pulses. The envelope of the recorded and reflected radar pulse is found by using the Hilbert Transform. Mathematically this is a process where the Fourier transform of the radar pulse is run, the negative frequencies are shifted 90 , and then an inverse Fourier transform is made. The net effect produces a signal which is totally in the positive domain and represents the envelope of the recorded pulse. (For those not comfortable with this mathematical description, a simpler and approximate way to understand the Hilbert transform is to think of a signal that is rectified – the absolute value of the pulse is taken – and connects all the peak   54  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.15 Example of a Hilbert transform on a migrated radargram taken across rebar buried in concrete. The Hilbert transform migrated reflections show remarkably “rounded” appearances. However, it should be noted that the bottom surfaces of the rebar are not actually recorded, but are given the appearance of being mapped by performing the Hilbert transform  responses). The Hilbert transformed radar pulses are useful in imaging situations to simply show regions of weak or strong reflections and where the imaging is not dependent on the phase of the radar pulse. An example of the Hilbert transform made on a migrated radargram is shown in Fig. 3.15. The Hilbert transformed pulses more closely represents the structure of the subsurface then a raw pulse since the oscillating components of the GPR pulse have been removed. A reflection from any flat interface for instance, will be mapped as a single strong (positive) reflection without negative related to the impulse response function of the transmitted pulse.  3.7  Deconvolution  Deconvolution is a signal processing method to help reduce multiple reflections and echoes recorded on radargrams as well as to minimize the effects of the transmitted pulse. The pulses that are transmitted by GPR antenna have a defined impulse response function. One kind of deconvolution filter is designed to remove the transmitted impulse response function from the recorded radargram. The recorded   3.7 Deconvolution  55  radargram pulses (r) can be described as a time convolution of the impulse response function of the antenna (i) along with reflection response of the ground (g): r ¼i g  (3.2)  What is really desired is simply to have the ground reflection response – which is essentially the ground structure – without the incursion of the transmitted impulse response of the antenna clouding the real ground features. One could imagine that if the impulse response of the transmit was many cycles long that all features below the first reflecting surface could be hidden by the reflection response from the top reflector. Removing the transmit antenna pulse from the radargram scan could help to show sharp interfaces in the ground for example, rather than viewing these interfaces as ringing reflection surfaces. To remove the impulse response function from real data, there are several deconvolution schemes available. The simplest deconvolution method is spectral division deconvolution. In this method both the recorded radar scan and the impulse response function of the antenna are taken into the frequency domain using a FFT. The complex radar scan is then divided by the known complex impulse response function in frequency space. Mathematically a convolution in time is represented by a simple multiplication/division process in frequency space, w. The ground response is found by dividing the frequency response of the radargram by the frequency response of transmitted impulse: GðwÞ ¼  RðwÞ IðwÞ  (3.3)  Taking an inverse FFT of this divided complex scan with the complex impulse response yields a deconvolved signal back in the time domain. (One of the problems with spectral division deconvolution is that the impulse response function in the frequency domain can have 0 frequency components. This can be easily handled by adjusting the divisor with a small constant called the Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov et al. 1995) and multiplying by the conjugate of the impulse frequency response function in the numerator and denominator). Another difficulty in deconvolution processing using spectral division deconvolution method is that the exact response of the radar antenna to not usually known. Attempts to measure the response in the laboratory may not transfer over to the in situ site as the local electrical impedances will change the coupling and refraction of the waves into the ground. To estimate the transmitted response it is common to often use the recorded ground wave reflection and to cut this out of the radargram as the generalized response function. An example of deconvolution using spectral division is shown in Fig. 3.16. The transmitter impulse response function of the antenna was generated from extracting the average scan across the entire radargram and using several cycles of the (estimated) response. A 10 % cosine taper on the edges of the pulse was implemented. The bottom deconvolved radargram shows two reflection legs   56  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.16 Comparison of a raw radargram deconvolved with spectral division. Several reverberating reflectors in the data are clearly illuminated by implementation of deconvolution filter  which are illuminated. In the raw radargram, these same reflection legs reverberate into each other and do not indicate discreet – separate reflectors at depth. In some environments the transmitted signal depending on the ground impedance, can reverberate in an out of the antenna box, generating a very complicated signal transmission into the ground. If the transmitted impulse can be estimated, then deconvolution by this method can have some useful results to discriminate reflectors and eliminate reverberation. Another consolation of the deconvolution process shown is that it can effectively remove the ground wave reflection. This is because the extracted ground wave was used to estimate the impulse response of the transmitted wave. In Fig. 3.16, the ground surface reflection response – from which the transmit impulse response is generated – effectively removes the ground wave. Other deconvolution methods used are cepstrum deconvolution and predictive deconvolution. In the cepstrum deconvolution method the logarithm of the spectral frequencies of the scans is used to filter and smooth the spectral amplitudes. The smoothed spectra using a simple logarithmic math filter will have the net effect of giving better balance and closer to equal weighting all the frequencies (Ulriksen 1982; Daniels 1996). For instance, imagine some frequency in the radargram has a spectral amplitude of 100 and another has a spectral amplitude of 10. In the cepstrum deconvolution, the logarithm of frequency with a spectral amplitude of 100 is 2 and logarithm of the frequency at 10 is 1, resulting in the spectral amplitudes becoming closer together. So gain renormalization is needed after Cepstrum deconvolution is implemented Cepstrum deconvolution is not as dramatic as the Spectral Whitening filter discussed, where all the frequencies are set to unity, but the general spectra plot is much smoother than the “bumpy” spectra plot   3.9 Smoothing/Stacking  57  of the frequencies from a raw radargram and give more equal weighting to the weaker frequencies. Predictive deconvolution uses all the previous parts of the recorded signal to predict the next value in the radar scan that will get recorded. The length of the previous samples along the radar scan and the weighting of previous samples determines the spatial filtering of multiple reflections. Predictive deconvolution was initially developed for the marine seismic surveys (Silvia and Robinson 1979). The waterborne seismic sources that travel directly downward into the ocean floor, also have a multiple echo source from the explosion that travels to the air-ocean interface and then reflects downward. This secondary “source” for the transmitted signals would mask recorded signals from the primary direct source. Similarly, GPR signals can have multiple sources usually from shallow targets which cause the initial transmit wave to go back up to the air-ground interface and then reverberate downward. Predictive deconvolution is a useful method to remove these secondary – multiple reflections as well.  3.8  Resampling  A basic signal process often has to be done to radargrams before any other signal process is implemented is called resampling. GPR profiles are sometimes collected over the ground with user inserted fiduciary markers used to set navigation tags in the radargram. The GPR control units are normally set to time modes, and a constant number of scans are recorded per unit time. If the velocity of the antenna over the ground varies, the number of scans per unit distance marker can vary. Before any processes such as migration or other filters that require knowledge of the spatial density of the scans, it is normally required to resample the radargram scans to a constant number of scans per unit distance. Shown in Fig. 3.17 is an original raw recorded radargram showing navigation tags that were placed every time the center of the antenna passed a meter marker. The bottom radargram is a resampled radargram where all the scans up to the first marker and all the scans after the last marker are removed from the resampled radargram. In addition, a constant number of scans are generated between the markers. The resampled scans are normally interpolated between any two scans that the resampled scan falls between. The resampling process can be used to generate more scans than was originally recorded in the raw radargrams, or to decimate the scan density between markers.  3.9  Smoothing/Stacking  Radargram scans can have high frequency noises which can be removed by bandpass filtering. Sometimes, what appears to be completely random noise has in fact small signals in the scans which when stacked together – added mathematically – will remove the random noises and enhance the small recorded signals.   58  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.17 Example of a raw recorded radargram with user inserted hand marker navigation tags placed into the radargram at 1 m intervals (top diagram). The resampled radargram have all the scans up to the first marker and after the last marker removed. The resampled radargrams also are interpolated/decimated to produce a constant number of resampled scans generated between the meter markers (bottom diagram)  Often the GPR control units can be adjusted to stack signals. Some of the commercial control units mistakenly say stacking when in fact they are actually doing a smoothing process – where N number of scans are added over the ground in a moving average. It is imperative to make GPR surveyors understand what the equipment being used is actually doing. To “instantaneously” add N number of scans in the exact same location is the traditional (seismic) stacking process, which can dramatically increase the signal-to-noise ratios. However, stacking has also been loosely used (by some manufacturers) when the actual process is a smoothing operation where scan addition over a spatial distance is implemented. Smoothing/Stacking can be done post processing if a significant number of scans are recorded over the ground with a high enough density. Shown in Fig. 3.18 are examples of stacking a noisy radargram. Stacks were done at 0, 2, 4, 10, and 25 scans. The radargrams even at 2 or 4 stacks shows significant improvement in signal-to-noise. The stacking of 25 scans has smoothed out all the scans over a horizontal distance of 0.5 m (based on 50 scans per meter for this resampled radargram). Stacking/smoothing this high number of scans has degraded and modified the original features and this would not be an appropriate number of scans to add together for this recorded radargram considering its native scan density. Today, GPR manufacturers are constantly improving the speed of GPR equipment that will eventually allow for higher stacking rates with improved signal-to-noise in the raw recorded. Such operations for improving stacking rates are essential as the FCC has limited the power of GPR transmissions.   3.9 Smoothing/Stacking  59  Fig. 3.18 A comparison of post-stacking of various number of GPR scans to eliminate recorded noises and to enhance the signals. Stacking in this case or smoothing too much can also degrade the quality of the radargrams and remove or diminish recorded reflection legs. Stacking in the field at “instantaneous” locations will however dramatically improve signal-to-noise ratios in the raw recorded pulses   60  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  Fig. 3.19 Several signal processes done on a raw radargram including, gaining, bandpass filtering, background filtering, migration and Hilbert transform   3.9 Smoothing/Stacking  61  Fig. 3.20 An example radargram with different color transforms applied to the recorded pulses. Using a high contrast transform seen in the bottom figure, many subtle reflection features can be illuminated   62  3 Basic GPR Signal Processing  An example radargram showing some of the more important signal processes from start to finish being applied to a single radargrams is given in Fig. 3.19. This radargram is gained, bandpassed, background filtered, migrated with a 2D velocity model, and then finally has the Hilbert transform process applied. Although signal processing can help to eliminate unwanted noises, any filtering to the radargrams can also have the adverse affect of removing some components in the signal that are related to the targets that are being detected. Before concluding this brief chapter on radargram signal processing, it should be mentioned that simple colorization of GPR pulses can also enhance the visualization of features recorded. Sometimes, radargrams can be “artificially” made to be composed of very clean pulses depending how colors are applied to the pulses for scan display, when in fact noise or even many subtle reflection features are stored in the digital signals. An example radargram using a bipolar color table with black representing reflections close to 0 with progressive rainbow color up to red at the strongest peak + and peak  signals is shown in Fig. 3.20 for three different transforms. The weak transforms show almost no background reflections features as seen in the top diagram – which are strikingly apparent when a strong color transform is applied to the recorded pulse in the bottom radargram.

Images that look across horizontal slices in the ground and changes in recorded reflection amplitudes are referred to as time slices (Goodman et al. 1995; Malagodi et al. 1996). Time slicing is an essential image process which can often contain the most important information on the subsurface archaeology at a site. They are called time slices since the vertical axis of the radargrams – before they are converted to depth with knowledge of the ground microwave velocities – is the travel time of reflections. In 1994, the authors had seen unpublished reports with images and photos that date back from as early as 1981 of a digital GPR system at Battelle National Laboratories in the US, with the antenna and electronic equipment being deployed by a tractor. In these unpublished reports, there are also the first versions of a time slice maps made at an archaeological site and the authors believe that these are probably the earliest time slices ever generated from GPR (?). One of the first applications of time slicing that was formally published is that by Nishimura and Kamei (1990), Goodman (1991) and Yamamoto et al. (1991). The earliest time slices constructed often would designate the horizontal pixel length equal to the profile spacing, and the pixel length along the line would represent the pulse spacing on the radargram profile. Some researchers would use rectangular pixels where all the pixels would be constrained to the profile spacing. An example of an early time slice construction is shown in Fig. 4.1. This method of image construction for single channel datasets where profile spacing is rather coarse compared to the scan density along the line makes for very difficult and poor quality images of the subsurface. It is difficult for the human eye to process and connect reflection anomalies from data presented in this form. As the profile spacing was made coarser the utility of the time slice method would be even less useful in mapping reflections. The profile density on archaeological sites taken was considered to be D. Goodman and S.

But 1 m pixels defined by the available software in the early days did not make for pretty subsurface images. To alleviate the discontinuities that was seen in images from coarsely spaced radar profiles in the constructed GPR volumes, the authors first attempt at generation of time slices was using contouring software to represent the horizontal distribution of reflection variance measured across a site (Goodman 1991). Full interpolation was instituted to fill in locations on the survey grid that were not directly sampled with GPR as well as to interpolate onto the grid where data already existed. The time slices were presented as contoured and interpolated GPR reflections maps and were an improvement. The translation to pixel based images from contoured images help to better show the details of horizontal reflection anomalies across a site. In these early days, digital commercial GPR equipment was still not available and analog output of GPR was digitized on external tape drives for post processing on a computer. The authors have been around long enough to have used one of the last analog GPR systems (Fig. 4.2). Making time slices with these data were quite cumbersome and took great care. One of the issues with the digitized analog data was that user inserted navigation markers were actually recorded as stripes of strong reflection within the raw binary scans (Fig. 4.3). The navigation markers had to be detected that were recorded with variable thresholds and great care was taken not to include the scans that had the high amplitudes of the marker infiltrating into the time slices. In 1990, the making of time slices would take upwards of a week or more since magnetic tape qualities were quite variable and skipped data records could cause headaches. By 1993 and with continued software development time slices of sites about the size of 0.5 Ha could be properly processed in about 6–8 h.   4.1 Early History of GPR Time Slicing  65  Fig. 4.2 One of the last generation analog SIR eight GPR units from Geophysical Survey Systems Inc. is shown. The console below the small TV monitor is a 16 mb tape drive that could typically record about 20–30 lines of 8 bit data that was digitized through a video card  Fig. 4.3 A typical radargram collected with this analog equipment had navigation markers stored as strong amplitudes recorded and imposed upon the radar scans. These navigation markers were detected in order to locate the scans on the ground. The markers were typically recorded as four scans thick on the raw radar records and the data infected by the navigation markers had to be skipped during the creation of time slice images  However, even with the use of analog GPR digitized to 8 bits, quality time slice images could be made. An example of a time slice made from the digitized analog records is shown in Fig. 4.4 at Nutubaru site in Shintomi Machi, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The radargrams were collected with an SIR 8 analog equipment from Geophysical Survey Systems Inc. which was the manufacture of the first commercial GPR systems. The site is the location of destroyed earthen mounds that were constructed in the Kofun Period (300–700 AD) in Japan. The time slice images showed a circular burial moat that was buried about 35 ns below the ground surface. Up until this time, the authors had never seen any geometrical structure imaged   66  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.4 An example of a time slice image made from analog GPR equipment is a circular moat from a destroyed Kofun burial at the Nutubaru site in Miyazaki Prefecture (Goodman et al. 1995). The surveyed area was 44 m   110 m and was collected on 2 field days (November 12–13, 1993) and results were published the next day in the Miyazaki Shimbun after all night processing on November 14, 1993. (At the time of the publication of the image, the authors were experiencing alignment problems with an older paint jet printer which caused some line streaking in the printed imaged)  from GPR on any sites that they had investigated. It “absolutely” indicated that the radar was able to reveal an area constructed by ancient dwellers as that perfectly round structure could not have been accidentally made by nature. It also indicated to the authors that the software was probably working properly on that occasion! A radargram taken across the burial moat is shown in Fig. 4.3. Two strong reflections at y ¼ 17 m and y ¼ 31 m are from reflections from a v-trench moat surrounding the destroyed burial. The structure was initially made by a moat being dug and the excavated material from the moat used to construct a round earthen mound 2–3 m in height in the interior. The newly constructed earthen mound would often have a very shallow grave on the top of the mound for the primary burial, as well as subterranean shaft-burial chambers being carved out below the mound for   4.2 Image Construction  67  relatives of the deceased. One very strong reflection can be seen in the interior of the burial moat (Fig. 4.4) which is a reflection from the roof material of a collapsed burial chamber. The Nutubaru burial mounds were eventually carved away by ancient and modern farmers over its 1,500 year history and buried by further volcanic eruption by the nearby active Mt. Kirishima, to be finally rediscovered in 1993 by GPR.  4.2  Image Construction  Most present day software dedicated to GPR have not evolved at all from these early days for properly constructing images from coarsely spaced profiles. Typical methodology for constructing images is usually by simple linear interpolation between radargram lines to connect pulses. Subsurface volumes and time slices generated in this way show significant problems. One such problem referred to as “weaving” noises show pseudo linear features infiltrating the images and give the appearance that the image is constructed by horizontal or vertical linear elements depending on the line direction (e.g. Fig. 4.5). Simple linear interpolation to connect the pulses also break down with XY cross survey datasets where the weaving characteristics can alternate in parts of the image when areal coverage is not constant in both directions. In the case with multi-channel datasets where the antenna separation is very close or where great care is used to navigate single channel antenna on the ground to cover all spaces within about a 1/4 wavelength of the microwave pulse (e.g. Grasmueck et al. 2005; Novo et al. 2008), the direct method of generating a 3D volume will create very useful images (shown in the multi-channel Chap. 9). However, most single channel users with coarse spacing will need to perform “proper” interpolation to connect reflection anomalies and to reasonably predict anomaly strengths between the recorded radargram profiles. The key in image construction for coarsely spaced radargram profiles is NOT to display every scan element and place into its 3D volume location but first to mathematically combine individual pulses along the radargram profile to make spatially averaged bins. The spatially averaged bins can be generated at similar lengths which are close to the distance interval between adjacent profiles. Then, using interpolation algorithms to estimate GPR reflection amplitudes at locations between spatially average bins, points on a grid between profiled lines can be properly estimated. A diagram indicating a spatially defined bin in time and length is shown in Fig. 4.6. Spatial bins along the radargram are generated at lengths dy equal to or less than the profile spacing dx. For example, if a profile spacing of 50 cm were used in a survey in a single direction, then spatial averaging along the radargram can be made at 50 cm to obtain a perfect square grid of data samples used in interpolation. The spatial bins can be increased to any density equal to or less than the native scan density on the ground. Usually bin lengths not less than 1/4 the profile spacing can be used. In the case where the bin length is much finer then the profile distance interval, the data along the profiled line will be over weighted and   68  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.5 Example of the false imaging, where simple linear interpolation between radargram pulses between adjacent profiles, creates a matrix of linear features. These false linear features give the impression that the GPR equipment perfectly imaged a “weaved” basket buried in the ground  Fig. 4.6 Depiction of spatial binning along a radargram. Spatial averages along the length as well as in time can be generated  imaging noises will start to become apparent. Using a square grid can give the best results since data is equally taken from surrounding quadrants to interpolate. The interpolation process involves searching out a distance away from a point on the desired grid and including all the spatially averaged bin data in the estimate. Two common interpolation algorithms, inverse distance and Kriging can be used to estimate a point on the grid between sampled locations.   4.2 Image Construction  69  Inverse distance – Estimation between surrounding data points using a distance weighting exponent is given in the equation, i.e. interpolated data d ¼  XN i¼1  w i di PN j¼1 wj  (4.1)  1 hs  (4.2)  where the weighting factor : wj ¼  h ¼ distance between nearby point and the point on the grid to be estimated s ¼ smoothing factor (commonly set to 2). The inverse exponential factor – or often called the smoothing factor – is used in weighting data by their distance to the desired point to be gridded. A lower value will more closely weight all values within the search radius equally; a higher value will more strongly weight data within the search radius that are closer to the desired grid point to estimate. For n ¼ 1 all the data discovered within the search radius is equally weighted. For n ¼> 2 for instance, data that is farther away has less influence then the nearby data points. For example, a data point 9 cm away would have a weight of 1/81 whereas a point 2 cm away would have a weight of ¼ or about 20 times as strong as the point at 9 cm (Note: the weights are usually normalized by the total number of binned data points, N, within the search radius). There are problems with inverse distance interpolation caused by singularities when the point to be estimated corresponds to an exact point where data was searched. In this instance the distance h ¼ 0 and a divide by zero can exist. This is commonly addressed by either limiting the weight of the data point at an exact location to have a weight no greater than one. Another weighting factor handles this problem effectively is using Shepherds weighting equation (Franke and Nielson, 1980) in the form: wi ¼  ðhm  hi Þ ðhm hi Þs  (4.3)  Where hm is the furthest distance between the discovered points and the gridding point and normally just set to the search radius. There is no divide by zero in this gridding weight. However it still can give gridding that is a touch dotty near strong points. Another alternative weighting that can be used is wi ¼ eshi=hm  (4.4)  where e is the natural log. In this weighting function singularities are effectively handled since e0 is 1. Kriging – is a method that solves a matrix covariance problem where the error between an estimated point and a binned data point is modeled. The variance between all points in the search radius is used to generate a variogram (Fig. 4.7). The variogram is then modeled using an exponential equation to produce weighting   70  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.7 Example of a variogram for a set of binned data to be used in Kriging interpolation. A curve is fit to give values of the sill, range, and nugget describing a model designed for the variance as a function of distance  coefficients (called the sill, nugget and range). Kriging interpolation will not necessarily weight closer data points to the desired gridded data point based on the closeness but on statistics that minimize solving the covariance matrix. Kriging provides an estimate of interpolated data based on inversion of the covariance matrix between all the combination of points in the search radius. The general equation describing data weights from Kriging interpolation is: w ¼ cij 1 d where cij ¼ c0 þ c1 if h ¼ 0 cij ¼ c1exp( 3h/a) if h > 0 a ¼ range at which covariance value remains constant h ¼ distance between points c0 ¼ nugget effect which provides a discontinuity at the origin c1 þ c0 ¼ sill which describes the value of the estimate at large distances cij 1 ¼ inverse covariance matrix of all searched point in the estimate d ¼ vector containing points in the search radius (after Isaacs and Srivastava 1989). Kriging is useful to better map corners and sharper structures buried in the ground. Advanced Kriging operation which examine directionality can also be employed (Issacs and Srivastava 1989).   4.2 Image Construction  71  Fig. 4.8 Examples of grid interpolation using different search radii for a random GPS track dataset. Search radius of 0.8, 1.8 and 4.8 m are used in interpolating the time slice dataset (from an ancient Indian village site in Strawtown, Indiana). Inverse distance interpolation is shown on the top row and Kriging on the bottom row for comparison (The single track radargram was corrected for 0 ns drift before time slices were computed)  One of the best ways to demonstrate the operations of interpolation is to examine the results for this process using a single GPS track of data collected on a random walk without a regular grid (Fig. 4.8). The interpolation process can be carried out to completely fill in all the gaps between the random track lines by using a large search radius. Blanked areas can also be preserved by limiting grid interpolation to only yield results when there is searched data that is within a distance threshold, and allowing this to be independently set differently from the search radius. This is useful in many surveyed sites where a large interpolation radius to smooth data is necessary, but to limit interpolation into areas which were not surveyed over.   72  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Comparison of interpolation results using inverse distance on the top row of Fig. 4.8 and Kriging interpolation in the bottom row are shown. The inverse distance will normally generate smoother time slice grid maps at the expense of removing small features. If the small features are actual noise than the smoother maps may be more appealing and relevant. However, some features can be completely smoothed over. The time slice generated from kriging shows more details. However, the general shapes of features can be lost in showing too much detail, and the interpretation of subsurface anomalies can be missed. It is sometimes useful to generate several maps with different interpolation settings and have both data available for interpretation.  4.2.1  Colorization  How data are colored is probably the most important component in presenting a time slice for interpretation. The interpretation of anomalies is directly related to how the colors are applied to a recorded dataset. There are an infinite number of ways to color data as color tables and color assignments can vary. One of the most common ways to color time slices is to examine the histogram of the data and apply colors to various parts of the data based on the standard deviation from the mean (Fig. 4.9). The number of standard deviations from the mean in this example uses a value of 3 to automatically assign colors to the data (histogram). Colors beyond three standard deviations can be assigned the peak color value or the lowest color value on each side of the histogram. This operation acts similar to a “de-spiking” used in magnetic datasets (Burks and Cook 2011). Here the peak high and low responses greater than or equal to three standard deviations from the mean are pegged to the colors defined at the maximum and the minimum. This process provides a method of weighting and showing amplitude changes over the most concentrated parts of the histogram (where perhaps most of the subsurface information of interest lies). The colorization and the transform is important particularly for illuminating the weaker reflections in a dataset as well as equally distributing color across the bulk of the data on the histogram. The interpreter of time slice images will need to usually manipulate the colorization to solve a particular subsurface imaging problem. It will not always be the case that default colorization settings for any given dataset will give the desired illumination of anomalies that will solve a subsurface imaging problem. Grayscale is also a very important colorization of data since, these images are often employed to give all the reflections equal weighting. Colored time slices, can generate very strong contrast depending on the color table between any two adjacent data values. For example data which is just one value away from data assigned as blue can be given the color red to make strong contrasts for the human eye. Whether or not this contrast is actually observed in the subsurface is not known, and the contrast may just an artificial illusion. Using a grayscale will apply hue/whiteness based on the equal changes in the data. The possibility of   4.2 Image Construction  73  Fig. 4.9 The application of color to a time slice dataset using the data histogram is diagrammed for both a grayscale and rainbow color table. In this examples colors are applied following a linear transform across a portion of the histogram that is three standard deviations on each side of the mean. The image shown is the Palo Alto Battlefield site in Brownsville, Texas which is the site where troops of the United States and Mexico first clashed in the Mexican-American War (Data courtesy, Steve DeVore, National Park Service)  showing a strong contrast between recorded data reflections that are close together is less likely. The grayscale is also preferred by some interpreters since the maps give equal importance in color contrast to all reflection changes. It should be noted that an infinite number of color contrasts and enhancements can be assigned to any time slice. It is the responsibility of the interpreter to assign   74  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  color contrast whether it be in grayscale or a color scale to best illuminate the subsurface archaeological contrasts. This is often not known what colorization is best for a site and only past experience may help with calibration of anomalies from test excavations. Experience can also bias one in how data are colorized for a particular site and archaeology. Archaeological contrasts can be missed or color application across the array of reflection strengths may get over amplified, creating contrasts where no actual archaeological structures of interest exist. The array of reflections strengths recorded at a site are a result of the electrical contrasts between the materials used by the ancient builders. It may be necessary to over-gain images with color in order to illuminate features when archaeological (electrical) contrasts are just slightly above the background. In this regard, linear grayscales may be less inclined to show archaeological boundaries whereas color application might more easily illuminate these subtle anomalous features. However, as we are not limited to a single image, both low and high contrast maps can be used in the site interpretation. In the example image shown in Fig. 4.9, subsurface anomalies from a site have been colorized with grayscale and a rainbow color table. In this examples colors are applied following a linear transform across a portion of the histogram that is three standard deviations on each side of the mean. The image shown is the Palo Alto Battlefield site in Brownsville, Texas which on May 8, 1846 troops of the United States and Mexico first clashed. The purpose of the survey was to try and identify older fort walls and battle emplacements/ramparts. The grayscale indicates a few anomalies but nothing that might relate as clearly defined ramparts. The color scale for this example shows a lot of anomalies that appear to be continuous in the yellow/orange color bands which may or may not have relevance to older destroyed ramparts. Some small circular like features in the center of the shallow time slice map and having dark centers can be clearly seen in the grayscale image and are nearly completely masked in the colored image. The results have currently not been fully corroborated via excavation and the data is still being interpreted; neither grayscale or color scale show overwhelming evidence of indicating suspected fort foundations or battlefield emplacements. Nonetheless, the differences in the application of color and grayscale show different areas of continuous and areas of noncontinuous reflection strengths. Which map might correlate better with future excavations has yet to be decided.  4.3  Field Practice  One of the most important operations in the GPR survey is determining the profile interval to be used. The density of lines is critical to the overall resolution that will be emulated in the subsurface images and whether or not the there was enough lines pulled to detect the structures. Profile intervals should normally be set to a least ½ or smaller of the length/width of subsurface targets desired to be imaged. For instance, if historic burials are on the order of 1   2 m are the targets, then the largest profile   4.3 Field Practice  75  Fig. 4.10 Depiction of the overlap of the GPR beam in the ground based on different profile spacing. The black triangle represents a shadow zone where no radar waves are effectively transmitted. The shallower targets might be, may require tighter survey lines in order to map these targets, as compared with deeper targets that are located in the zone where the GPR beam overlaps  spacing one would want to use in the survey would be 0.5 m should the profile direction be parallel to the burials. If the burials directions are known prior to the survey, then a coarser spacing might suffice. However, in a blind survey an even denser spacing of 0.25 m could be used to give much clearer definitions, but collecting profiles at least denser than ½ the minimum target dimension can suffice. What goes against a surveyor’s initial thinking on a site is that the shallower the targets are, the less density of profiles that is needed in the survey to detect them. This is completely the opposite of what is required – the shallower the structures are buried, the denser the line spacing that must be expedited for shallow detection! Depicted in Fig. 4.10 is an idealized GPR beam response. The deeper in the ground the radar beam penetrates, the more likely that overlapped areas of detection between adjacent lines occur. Only in the near surface regions is there a shadow zone between profiles where no radar waves travel into the site (assuming a beam that is not completely hemispherical and has little or no energy transmitted at near broadside angles). Most surveyors will often take profiles very dense in one direction and then at coarser densities in the cross direction. Mixing these data intelligibly to make a combined grid often do not yield satisfactory results. This is because the sampling is not consistent in both directions and the resulting combined gridded images will manifest these sampling deficiencies. Taking data at twice the density in one direction will usually provide more useful images than combining data collected at twice a coarser spacing in both directions. However in the case of utility mapping or features that have long and thin linear dimensions, surveying in both directions with single channel equipment might be required for detection. (Of course a multichannel system would have no such problems as the array density on the order of 4–8 cm are sufficient to map most features larger than this in the cross-line direction in one swath). In terms of mapping features and providing convincing subsurface images that the target features have been identified, the areas recorded should usually be larger   76  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  than the known areal extent of the structures. The depth of penetration to profile should also be at least 1.5–2 times the suspected depth of the targets. The antenna chosen to perform a survey is often mistakenly used by researchers because they want to realize the highest resolution possible. At the same time the frequency of the antenna can limit the depth of penetration or provide so “much” resolution that the larger shape of targets are replaced by small – unconnected component reflections that mask the bigger general archaeological features. Lower frequency antenna also usually have a larger aperture and can sample the entire surface of a site with less holes in the grid than a higher frequency – smaller aperture antenna profiled at the same density. Taking a step down to a lower frequency can often insure the success of a survey if only one antenna is to be used. Detecting the larger features at a site at the cost of giving up on resolution should usually be given consideration. Recent GPR equipment (e.g. IDS Duo of Italy) have low frequency and high frequency antenna such as a 250 and 700 MHz co-located in the same box, making for easy collection of shallow and deeper targets simultaneously.  4.4  Image Processing: Staggering Noise  Often after images are constructed from processed GPR radargrams there can still be various kinds of noises present in the images. The noise present can be in the data even after complete RSP has been applied to the radargrams. The most common noise seen in GPR time slice images after creation are staggering noises, mosaic and line/striping noises. Many sites in archaeological investigations are surveyed in a zigzag mode, where adjacent lines are recorded in the forward and reverse directions. Profiling a site this way can save enormous amounts of time in the GPR survey but can also create noises in the resulting images. The noise comes about from small navigation offsets/shifts between the adjacent profiles. The staggering can be caused by several factors including operator errors, or from small delays in electronic start times of the radar control units which create the staggered effect. One manufactured GPR system has a set buffer that gets appended to the end of radargrams whether data is actually recorded into the file write buffer or not and is one example of staggering that is innate to the specific equipment employed. User generated staggering errors can occur if the center of the antenna – exactly half way between the transmitter and the receiver where navigation should be tagged – is not properly identified and used in the survey. For instance, if the front of an antenna was used to start and stop radargram profiles from a zigzag survey, then the distance from the antenna center to the front of the antenna, will cause adjacent lines to be shifted to one another. The shift or staggering between these lines in the time slice images will be twice this distance. Staggering however, can also be from other electronic issues in the control units such as phase delays in the marker assignment from either hand or survey wheel markers. Staggering is not   4.4 Image Processing: Staggering Noise  77  Fig. 4.11 Example of staggering noises shows a small navigation shift between adjacent profiles. In this example, the staggering noise was caused by electronic recording issues and not due to the physical location of the antenna that was navigated on the site  always apparent in every collected zigzag datasets so it is not going to be a universal approach to processing all GPR datasets. An example of a time slice with staggering noises is shown in Fig. 4.11. This data is an image from a Hopewell Indian village collected at the Chillicothe site in Ohio. The radar profiles were recorded with an external survey and with the center of the antenna used to travel from baseline to baseline in the data collection. Nonetheless, spatial shifts between adjacent lines can clearly be seen in the (ancient village) wall feature imaged. This is an example of staggering caused by electronic recording problems. To correct for this problem, the amount of the constant shift is identified and the reverse lines and forward lines can be shifted by a defined staggering length. The corrected image for this dataset is shown in Fig. 4.11. Physical construction of the antenna can also be responsible for apparent staggering noises. Shown in Fig. 4.12 is a description of an antenna where the transmitter and the receiver are separated by a defined distance. If transmitt beam of the GPR antenna is more directional, e.g. does not have as much energy being transmitted to the sides, then a shallow object may not be detected at the exact same location from a forward and reverse line, as depicted in Fig. 4.12. When the antenna patterns between the transmitter and the receiver are not identical, staggering effects   78  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.12 One possible cause of staggering can also be from the antenna configuration and the separation of the transmitter from the receiver in the antenna box. In this description where the beam transmitted is more directional, forward and reverse line may not detect a shallow target at the exact same location. Common Tx  Rx separations from several manufacturers are listed in Table 4.1  become more apparent in zig-zag surveys. Common transmitter-receivers offsets of some of the more popular antennas from several manufacturers are listed in Table 4.1. The physical separation of the antenna merits further discussion in the next section on how imagery can be affected.  4.5  Zigzag Non-reciprocity  Zigzag surveys after staggering problem have been adjusted for, can still have recorded radargrams that look alternately different when recorded in forward and reverse directions. Profiling over a subsurface target can look very different when profiles are taken in the forward direction and compared to the exact line taken in the reverse direction. This is primarily a function of the kind of targets and features that are in the subsurface. The non-similarity of the antenna receiver and transmitter responses also play a part. The best way to show this “phenomena” is to look at a simulation example for profiles collected in the forward and reverse directions. Shown in Fig. 4.13 is such model where radargram profiling over some shallow (synthetic) structures generate significantly different radar patterns between the profiles collected in the forward direction compared with the reverse direction. In the simulation the distance between the receiving and transmitting antennas inside the single antenna box is modeled to be 30 cm. This separation is not uncommon for commercial antenna in the frequency range of 200–400 MHz (Table 4.1). Sharper features, particularly if they are very shallow can dramatically enhance the apparent differences between forward and reverse profiles. Because of the dissimilar appearance of forward and reverse profiles and the fact that complete reciprocity is not   4.6 GPS Staggering Noises Table 4.1 Antenna transmitter-receiver separations from several manufacturers  79  Manufacturer Mala  Sensors and software  GSSI  US radar  IDS  Freq.

Some surveyors in order to ameliorate this problem but still do fast surveys, will design field equipment carts where the antenna is not rotated; and the cart is kept in the same orientation on the return trip (e.g. Neubauer et al. 2002). This will help to remove differences from transmitter/receiver separation from doing a zigzag survey. In general, some surveyors are of the opinion that zig-zag surveys have a better chance to discover subsurface structures than simply taking data in a single direction. It is possible that some shallow structures are better detected in one direction than the other so mixing of zig-zag lines might better insure detectability. Other surveyors highly regard getting “more” congruent profiles offered by profiles collected in the same direction. The jury is still out on the best method, and perhaps neither can ultimately be claimed as the best method as site structures may lend one to be better or worse.  4.6  GPS Staggering Noises  Staggering noises can also be seen in time slices images from GPS navigated surveys. The staggering in these datasets usually can come about from either a time lag – GPS latency – or a scan lag between the GPS logger and the synced GPR control unit. The net effect is to shift the lines forward or backward a small amount. The staggering can be dramatically seen in datasets when the GPS tracks are profiled similar to a zigzag survey with radargrams recorded in a continuous forward and reverse direction. An example of a time slice with constant scan lag staggering is shown in Fig. 4.14 along with a scan lag corrected time slice. This   80  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.13 Different profile directions across the same structure can yield different recorded radar patterns. The small separation in the transmitting and receiving antennas and sharp abrupt changes in subsurface features that are shallow can produce significantly different responses  dataset, collected with a Sensors and Software Noggin system, was easily corrected by shifting all the GPS NMEA strings by a constant number of scans. For this particular dataset the recorded NMEA string was assigned to the GPR scans that were exactly 30 scans earlier than the GPR log file reported to correct for   4.6 GPS Staggering Noises  81  Fig. 4.14 In this example a time slice generated from a GPS navigated survey shows staggering noises cause by a scan lag between GPS logger and the GPR control unit (top diagram). The corrected time slice (bottom diagram) is found by shifting all the assigned GPS NMEA strings by a constant number of scans (Data courtesy of Brian Herridge, 3D Geophysics)  staggering. Depending on the velocity of the collection, the shifts could be as much a 2–3 m for this particular dataset. The most difficult situation with scan lag staggering noises embedded in GPS/ GPR datasets is for the user to identify this noise and realize it is of a navigational origin and is not related to site noises or noises related to the equipment. One of the key pieces of evidence to recognize scan lag staggering noise is to identify what may appear to be alternating weak-strong-weak strong reflection strengths – on what would otherwise be continuous anomalies. The staggering noise might also be incorrectly identified as simple profiling line noises. In this case, attempts at background filtering or even using the process of decoupled gridding (discussed later) based on the dividing the site into collection directions of the antenna could prove to yield erroneous “corrected” images. The possibility of GPS staggering   82  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  noise should first be investigated if similar noises to those seen in top image in Fig. 4.12 are observed. GPS latency navigation errors can also be seen on zig-zag surveys made across known horizontal structures, such as subsurface pipes, and can be easily identified and fixed. One important GPS noise that is often neglected or “undetected” by many surveyors are problems related to replicated/double GPS points which can have dire consequences if not repaired. The desire to have GPS synced to every scan or every certain number of scans are often not realized in many GPR/GPS surveys with today’s technology. Even though the GPS might claim to be written on every scan or every Nth scan, in fact, many GPS loggers in conjunction with the GPR equipment might only be able to update the real GPS position at some frequency lower than what is being outputted to the NMEA log files. Identical GPS points will often be written even though the scan numbers are incrementing. Not removing these double or multiple GPS points will improperly imprint reflection information at bunched locations in the imagery. Consecutive identical GPS points must be filtered first so that real updated GPS information can be used to properly dead reckon the recorded scans on the survey site.  4.7  Mosaic Noise  GPR can be infiltrated with mosaic noises which can make for difficulty in interpreting subsurface imagery. Mosaic noises represent abrupt changes in background reflection strengths recorded between adjacent or nearby survey grids that are compiled to a master grid. The abrupt changes can be a result of equipment noises, geological noises, and/or varying field conditions caused by weather. Apparent mosaic noises can also be caused by improper identification and correction of the 0 ns offset on the radargrams. In addition, untrained operators of GPR equipment may accidentally insert mosaic noises into the data if inconsistent radar control unit settings such as variable gain are used and are recorded at different locations to study a site. GPR surveys which occur over several field days will often lead to inherent mosaic noises in GPR dataset. Soil conditions such as moisture content or even temperature can vary significantly day-to-day, altering the overall reflections strengths recorded in the different survey grids. An example of mosaic noises that were recorded within a large survey grid at a site in Tokushima prefecture, Japan is shown in Fig. 4.15. The purpose of the survey was to identify earthen foundations that may be contiguous with an eighth century Daimon womens temple that was partially excavated. The mosaic noises at this site were caused by geological and moisture changes between many adjacent fields in the survey grid. Some of the fields were being prepared for planting and were wet with dark fertilizer on the ground cover and other areas were completely dry and without fertilizer. A total of nine different areas can be seen in the shallow time slice image which indicates either very weak or very strong overall reflections for those particular survey grids. An example of two radargrams taken from adjacent   4.8 Mosaic Noise Correction Methods  83  Fig. 4.15 An example of the dramatic changes in overall reflection strengths recorded on a shallow time slice map in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. The mosaic noises surround portions of an excavated eighth century Daimon womens’ temple (Survey made for the Archaeology Division, Dept of Education, Tokushima Prefecture in conjunction with Nara National Cultural Properties Research Institute)  fields at the site, indicate how different the background reflections are on the raw recorded radargrams between two adjacent fields (Fig. 4.15).  4.8  Mosaic Noise Correction Methods  Whatever the cause for mosaic noises, their removal during image processing is essential to detecting continuous subsurface features across a site. Several methods exist for removing mosaic noises: Transform matching: One of the most common methods for correcting mosaics involves breaking a large survey grid into numerous sub-grids where gain changes are identified and then applying data transforms to best match all the sub-grids. A composite grid containing all the transform adjusted sub-grids can then be appended and a mosaic corrected image is generated. This method usually gives the best results but takes the longest to produce final corrected images. 0 mean (or median) grid removal: Another method to remove mosaic noises involves identifying the block of radargrams from each sub-grid with its own discrete mosaic noise, and subtracting the average background reflection from each sub-grid. Subtraction of the overall average reflection from a grid can   84  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.16 Visual description of histogram matching for balancing mosaic noises between two (or more) sub-grids  sometimes work to automatically balance the grids, but areas with stronger reflections can inadvertently create overestimates of the average value, and not work properly. For this reason, thresholding to not include some percentage above or below the maximum/minimum values can be implemented to get a better estimate of an average reflection value to subtract from each sub-grid in mosaic balancing. The median reflection can also be used in the mosaic correction. 0 mean line removal: In this mosaic correction method, the average reflection from each individual profile line is removed from the time slice image. It is similar in action to the application of a background filter to the radargrams, but is applied to the time slice parameter across an individual line. This can produce mosaic corrected images in some instances, but as shown in the next pages, this method can also remove important features that are parallel to the profile direction. Edge matching: Adjacent time slice lines between two grids where gain changes are apparent are matched by normalizing one of the lines to have the same dynamic range and average. The purpose for edge matching as opposed to using an overall grid matching like 0 mean grid, is that the adjacent line should have similar reflection field strengths at this similar location after the regaining and normalization of the two lines is made. Histogram matching: Another variation on transform matching is “stretching” the histograms to be matched. This methodology can be seen by a simple example for just two histograms (Fig. 4.16). The histogram from area 1 has a slight bell shape curve that is broader and with the average reflection closer to halfway point   4.8 Mosaic Noise Correction Methods  85  Fig. 4.17 Example of mosaic corrections accomplished by adjusting the transforms from individual sub-grids, such that colorization from each of the separate grids match when compiled back to a comprehensive grid  between the peak and smallest reflectors. The histogram from area 2 is a narrower, slightly bell-shaped histogram that is shifted toward the low end of the reflections. The histogram matching can look at three standard deviations away from the average time slice value for example, and the operation will apply a gain factor to one of the datasets to stretch or shrink the histogram so that the junctures where the three standard deviations on each side of the mean lines up. The process will also shift the means so that these can also match closely. An example of most effective but often most time consuming mosaic correction operation described in method 1, using the transform matching and balancing of sub-grids, is shown in Fig. 4.17. The unique shape of the transform essentially customizes the color table over the histogram of the individual sub-grid so that colors will match and be blended when the composite grid is appended. It should be noted, that a perfect match may never be completely realized for some datasets. Certain noises or completely different or double humped histograms for one site, which do not appear for a second site might not lend itself completely well for automated mosaic noise correction. These sites may have to be nurtured by transform matching and iteratively corrected to balance the colorization between the grids that are compiled. Sometimes, there may also be significant noises at the edges of recorded sub-grids where the equipment stopped at the end or beginning of the profile. Sometimes if the equipment is set to the time mode – e.g. continually sending out radar waves, the ground can get charged and stronger reflections can be recorded into the radargrams at the edges of grids. These noises are difficult to   86  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.18 A grid with nearly 50 sub-grids was collected at a site in Ossabaw Island Georgia adjacent to tabby slave houses (Data courtesy of Dan Elliot, www.lamarinstitute.com)   4.8 Mosaic Noise Correction Methods  87  Fig. 4.19 Zero mean grid mosaic correction from a site in Ossabaw Island Georgia. The bottom image represents the difference between the raw time slice and the 0 mean corrected time slice  remove other than by blanking out this data and interpolating further into the edges of the sub-grids prior to appending to a master grid. Another site with subtler mosaic noises is from a survey made adjacent to tabby slave houses in Ossabaw Island Georgia (Fig. 4.18). The purpose of the survey was to locate graves and possible destroyed features surrounding the slave quarters that were originally constructed in the late 1780–1790s. An example 0 mean grid and 0 mean line mosaic removal is shown in Figs. 4.19 and 4.20. The 0 mean line correction shows linear striations in the noise plot which is the difference between the original raw time slice and the 0 mean line corrected time slice. The noise plot, in addition to showing the calculated linear noise changes lineto-line, also shows some remnants features which indicate the sub-grids designation as well. This suggests that there are localized noises as well as sub-grid larger noises that can be removed via the 0 mean line calculations for mosaic corrections. The 0 mean line correction often exhibits the appearance of performing better at mosaic noise correction than the 0 mean grid correction. One of the disadvantages of the 0 mean line correction however, is that linear features that are parallel to any   88  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.20 Example of a 0 mean line mosaic corrected image. The noise plot on the bottom shows line noise variations but also shows remnants of the sub-grid blocks  single line in the dataset can be removed from the mosaic noise corrected image. To visualize this effect, one linear feature seen on the raw time slice and identified by an arrow in Fig. 4.18 is shown to be degraded on the 0 mean line mosaic corrected image (Fig. 4.20). The 0 mean grid correction (Fig. 4.19) still shows the horizontal linear reflection since only the average reflection of the entire sub-grid was subtracted – preserving the linear feature. Note, vertical and non-horizontal linear features are preserved in both the 0 mean line and the 0 mean grid images since these features are transverse to the radargram profile direction and are not filtered out by these mosaic correction methods.  4.9  Apparent Mosaic Noises: 0 ns Offset Positioning Errors  The true definition of time 0 is difficult to determine and many investigators will look at different “parts” of the initial return groundwave reflection to set time 0 (Yelf and Yelf 2007). The 0 ns position can also change depending on the ground   4.9 Apparent Mosaic Noises: 0 ns Offset Positioning Errors  89  material being surveyed. We choose the definition of the first measured arrival as time 0 (as the authors are both seismologists from their early geophysical training). Some backing for this comes from looking at time slices at 1 sample thick at the first arrival detection, and noting that changes can be seen in these images. The coupling of the antenna on the ground can affect the recorded amplitude on the first arrival, and thus a seismic definition is not a highly unacceptable definition for time 0 in our opinion. Whatever, the definition of the 0 ns that is used, the radargram data must be corrected to a consistently defined 0 ns offset otherwise time slice images with apparent mosaic noises can result. A set of radargrams collected from one site in Cambodia (data courtesy of Till Sonnemann, University of Sydney), shows the 0 ns offset changing within a line as well as constant offset changes between different lines (Fig. 4.21). The 0 ns offset can be corrected for by (a) looking at the radargrams scan-by-scan to trigger on a set threshold in the initial rise of the radar pulse for defining the ground surface reflection, or by (b) using an averaged 0 ns offset (line-by-line) in case the data are noisy before the anticipated ground wave reflection. Processing of a dataset for comparison where no 0 ns offsets are considered, where the 0 ns offset are processed line-by-line, as well as scan-by-scan are shown in Fig. 4.21. The apparent mosaic noises in the raw time slices show dramatic changes in amplitude. The line-by-line corrected radargram dataset shows most of the mosaic noises being accounted for except for a small error near line x ¼ 0. Here is where one recorded radargram had an offset changing in the middle of the line. The scan-by-scan 0 ns offset correction was able to properly detect and adjust all the radargrams so that the ground waves were properly positioned on each scan. The time slices for these data look the best and are completely free of mosaic noises. The time slices previously shown in Fig. 4.8 were generated from a GPS radargram where the drift of the 0 ns position was removed first. Changes in the 0 ns position for this data was actually significant enough to produce relatively strong mosaic/gain noises along the track. The gaining noise can be seen in areas where the GPS single track crosses over previously profiled track positions (middle diagram, Fig. 4.22). The data for the site was collected over 23 min on a single recorded GPS track. The time between overlapping of the tracks had only about 10 min transpire but was enough to significantly alter the offset. The drift in 0 ns offset along the radargram was removed using a scan-by-scan detection of the ground surface wave and truncating all the scans to a common depth for processing. The corrected image shows no artifacts of the 0 ns drift and gaining problem. GPS radargrams taken over long periods might exhibit 0 ns offset problems more often since the equipment is left on for longer times and temperature related equipment drift may be more prevalent. These are easy enough to correct for however, if these noises are first identified in the raw time slice dataset.   90  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.21 In this figure apparent mosaic noises caused by changes in the 0 ns offset from a radargram dataset is shown. The first radargram shows changes in the 0 ns position along the line. The other radargrams show a constant offset that changes between the lines. Comparisons are shown for 0 ns uncorrected, line-by-line corrected, and scan-by-scan time 0 corrected time slices   4.10  Decoupled Gridding: Removal of (Shielding) Line Noise  91  Fig. 4.22 Example of a time slice made from a single GPS track radargram collected over 23 min. A comparison of the time slice is made with a 0 ns drift corrected and uncorrected radargram on the site. Where the GPS tracks cross in the center of the site, significant gain changes can be seen between the later and earlier recorded track lines  4.10  Decoupled Gridding: Removal of (Shielding) Line Noise  Often GPR time slices can often show line noises. The noises are parallel to the profile direction and thus can indicate variations in gain, frequency response, or other changes that illuminate and make each individual profile slightly different. Often, line noises can be removed by first applying background filters to the radargrams prior to time slice creation. However, in some cases, even after background filters are applied, line noises can still persist. On specialized noise has been identified in GPR radargrams that we can best describe as “shielding line noise” (Fig. 4.23 top diagram). Very often some zig-zag surveys will show alternately strong-weak overall recorded reflections between adjacent lines. This may be a result of some external and directional outside microwave source which may affect the overall recorded reflections. The external microwave source if it has some discreet direction to it, may slightly affect the recorded reflections within a slightly unshielded antenna box that is dependent on the orientation of the transmitterreceiver with the external field (see an example field situation in Fig. 4.24). These special line noises may also be a result of some change in the configuration in the field. The location of cables or some other field setup that causes changes slightly between forward and reverse lines can also be seen in GPR datasets, particularly for surveyed sites where long tethered antenna cables are used in the data collection. In the example dataset, the line noises alternate between forward and reverse lines. The line noise and overall reflections appears stronger on the reverse lines and weaker on the forward lines. This weak-strong-weak-strong pattern following the   92  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.23 The process of decoupled gridding, where forward and reverse lines are independently calculated and grid math is used to add back the decoupled components is diagramed  direction of the antenna is designated as “shielding” line noises as a possible diagnosis to best describe these observations. There are useful processing steps to remove this noise. One of the best ways to do this is to create two separate grid maps of forward and reverse lines and then apply grid math to add these time slice maps back together. Using grid math will naturally remove any constant gain factors or reflection changes that are unique to each profiled direction. This method of removing forward and reverse noise changes is given the name “decoupled gridding”. Application of grid math is shown in Fig. 4.23. The forward and reverse time slice maps are generated separately (middle diagrams) and then added back together (bottom diagram). The time slices can also be added with a multiplication constant to give equal weighting to the forward and   4.11  Decoupled Gridding: Enhancing Linear Anomalies in XY Cross Grid Surveys  93  Fig. 4.24 One possible source for line noises may be external microwave/directional microwave sources that interact with GPR antenna that are not completely shielded. The net result can be noises which can be seen to alternate line-to-line on the generated images made from zig-zag surveys  reverse maps. One artifact of applying these filtering processes is that the resulting reflection anomalies can look a touch more smoothed out than on the original time slice map. Nonetheless, the line noises associated with shielding problems can be effectively removed by decoupling the data, manufacturing images separately for forward and reverse lines, followed by adding the separate images back together.  4.11  Decoupled Gridding: Enhancing Linear Anomalies in XY Cross Grid Surveys  The process of decoupled gridding is not only useful for removing line noises seen in combined forward and reverse datasets, but this method can also be used effectively in synthesizing cross grids surveys in both x and y directions to enhance linear anomalies. The key component to enhancing linear anomalies is to apply differential spatial searches during the interpolation of time slices. Elliptical or rectangular searches are used in the construction of the time slices grids (Fig. 4.25). For instance, time slice maps generated from profiles collected in the x direction, nearby data points on the x line can be limited to including only the binned data that is very close; whereas searched data in the y direction can be extended further. The net effect is to connect anomalies transverse to the x lines across to adjacent lines. Similarly, the elliptical searches are used in generating time slices from the y lines, where the search radius is very narrow in the y direction, but extended in the x direction – transverse to the profiled line. The final operation is then to combine the decoupled grids made in the x and y directions using simple mathematical addition (or using only the peak response of either direction).   94  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  Fig. 4.25 Differential searching for time slice interpolation is a key procedure in decoupled gridding. Elliptical searches where the major axis is longer transverse to the profile direction, can enhance linear anomalies that are parallel to the decoupled lines  Fig. 4.26 Examples of decoupled gridding where linear features transverse to x and y profiles are enhanced separately by differential searches in the time slice interpolation process. Separated – decoupled x and y time slices are shown (top two diagrams), along with the grid synthesized from mathematical addition (shown on the bottom left diagram). The time slice map found from regular combined gridding is shown in the right bottom diagram for comparison  Shown Fig. 4.26 are decoupled x and y time slice grids that were generated with differential searches along with the x þ y time slice map. The time slice map generated from combined and simultaneous gridding of the xy data is also shown   4.12  Image Matrix Operations  95  for comparison. The xy combined map still shows the same basic features but with less detail. In this example the x search radius was set to 0.5 in. and the y search radius was 7 in. Identical elliptical searches were made for the y lines of the grid with 0.5 and 7 in. in the parallel and transverse directions. For this particular dataset, images of a rebar mesh buried in concrete are shown to be significantly enhanced when compared with the simultaneously/combined xy grids. The dotty pattern seen in the combined grid solution can be understood as a result of instituting a simple circular or rectangular search radius applied to the entire combined xy data. For continuous linear features that need to be interpolated on a grid with regular search distances, some interpolated locations will have stronger or weaker cells depending on the movement of the search radius on top of the data grid – resulting in the dotty pattern. In general, performing combined gridding where both x and y cross lines are included is generally better to implement when there is no prior knowledge of what kind of structures are beneath the survey site. Decoupled gridding is primarily useful when linear subsurface structures are presence and these structures are more or less parallel to the profiled lines. Having looked at the first set of combined grids, and if the linear structures meet the criteria of being parallel to the profile directions, then decoupled gridding can be implemented as a secondary process to better enhance these linear features.  4.12  Image Matrix Operations  A variety of mathematical processes to illuminate features hidden in images that are not necessarily noisy, can greatly assist in the interpretation and detection of subsurface features. For instance, there may be large background reflections that hide smaller scale features in the images. In this instance, using a filter to remove the background reflections and to only look at differences or changes from the overall background feature may be useful. This can be likened to the background filter being applied to the radargrams in which the average pulse is removed. Other image filter operations such as smoothing or sharpening of an image can also help to remove the clutter in the image or show more detail. Many of the mathematical processes can be implemented as a matrix operator convolved with the grids. Some of the most common kinds of matrix operators are exemplified with simple 3   3 matrices (Daniels 1996). These operations however can be extended to larger operators working on a grid set, e.g. 5   5, 17   17, N   N. Each of the matrix filters are applied to each point in the grid and examines the surrounding grid points using the matrix convolution of the filter with the grid. Some common matrix filters are:   96 3   3 Low pass –  3   3 Hi pass/sharpen  3   3 Boxcar subtract  Vertical/horizontal enhance  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1 1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1  0 1 0 1 5 1 0 1 0  1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1  The low pass filter will smooth out the time slice grid by essentially averaging grid elements over the size of the filter. The hi pass filter operator enhances the differences between surrounding grid elements. The boxcar subtraction filter generates an average of the grid over the desired filter size and then subtracts that from the center point of the grid filter. This can remove background reflections in both x and y directions. Enhancements of reflections in the vertical or horizontal directions on a time slice image can be implemented using matrix filters. The matrix operation for vertical and horizontal enhancements are different then decoupled gridding in that these filters act on the gridded data and not on the raw data that was used to generate the grid. Another useful image process is to apply line filters to the time slice images. These filters are normally applied across the image in the profile direction and are useful for removing line noise. The (vertical) line filter is similar to the 0 mean line except for one extra variable – the length of the filter. The 0 mean line operation normally subtracts the average reflection from the entire line. The grid line filter allows an average reflection of any desired length along the filter to be continuously calculated and removed at the center of the filter. This allows for the filter to adjust to changing background conditions along the profile and to remove the local background reflection. Care must be used in applying vertical or horizontal line filters as they can inadvertently remove linear features parallel to the direction of the filter. An example of processing of a raw time slice image to illuminate hidden features is shown in Fig. 4.27. In a shallow time slice map from the Nutubaru site in Shintomi Machi, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, a raw time slice image shows strong vertical features related to plow scars, geology or wetness, or possibly battery drift during the collection (top diagram, Fig. 4.27). The general trend of lineation from farming at the site were parallel to the profiles for this particular survey. Applying a vertical line filter where the average reflection found from all the data below a 90 % threshold of the peak response was applied to the image (middle diagram Fig. 4.27). A low pass filter was applied to the vertical line filtered image to further clean it up and to slightly connect adjacent anomalies better. There is some loss of resolution by applying a low pass filter, at the same time the perceived “loss” of resolution may actually be the removal of image clutter and noise which has no translation to   4.12  Image Matrix Operations  97  Fig. 4.27 An original raw time slice (top diagram) is vertically line filtered (middle diagram) and then smoothed (bottom diagram) to reveal portions of a medieval corral wall at the Nutubaru site, Shintomi Machi, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan   98  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  actual features observable in the ground. The vertical line filtered and smoothed image shows significant features and many anomalies are revealed that are not seen in the raw image. One diagonal anomaly can be seen and identified on the filtered image. This anomaly was later identified as an Edo period (1603–1867 AD) corral wall for horses.  4.13  2D Fast Fourier Transform: Time Slice Filtering  An extremely powerful method for filtering and removing noises seen on time slice datasets is 2D Fast Fourier Transform filtering. In this method the time slices are converted to the spatial frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms (Smith 1997): Fðx; yÞ ¼  M 1 X N 1 X  f ðm; nÞe j2pðxMþyNÞ m  n  m¼0 n¼0  f ðm; nÞ ¼  M 1 N 1 XX  Fðx; yÞej2pðxMþyNÞ m  n  m¼0 n¼0  where x and y are the coordinate location, M and N the grid dimensions, f(m, n) is the 2D Fast Fourier Transform of the time slice data F(x, y). Noises in the time slice can be selectively filtered by setting those desired spatial frequency components in the transformed data f(m, n) to 0 before computing the inverse Fourier Transform F(x, y). An example of using 2D-Fast Fourier Transforms to remove noise from plow scars on time slices is shown in Fig. 4.28. In the original time slice from 21 to 25 ns the plow scars can be observed at approximately a 45˚ angle to the radar profiles and the grid. Transforming the time slice with a 2D-Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the spatial frequency components comprising the plow scars can be clearly seen (Fig. 4.28a). The spatial components of the plow scars in frequency space are identified as linear features that have a direction that are normal to the plow scars seen on the time slices. Selectively blanking out these spatial frequency components (Fig. 4.28c) and taking the inverse 2D-FFT the plow scars can be nearly completely suppressed in the filtered time slice (Fig. 4.28d). In addition, just the contribution of the plow scars can be visualized by leaving in the relevant spatial frequencies and blanking other components (Fig. 4.28e, f). The 2D-FFT filtering is very sensitive to low frequencies near the center of the image. Typically 2D-FFT filtering requires binary grid sizes to implement Fast Fourier Transforms; however, grid resampling can also be effectively done when the native grids are not binary sizes.   4.13  2D Fast Fourier Transform: Time Slice Filtering  99  Fig. 4.28 A time slice image infiltrated with plow scars (b) is converted to spatial frequency (a). Applying a filter where the plow scar spatial frequency components are filtered out, a time slice image with plow scars suppressed can be calculated (c, d). For comparison, another filter where the plow scars are enhanced is shown in figure parts (e, f) (Data courtesy of the British School at Rome)   100  4 GPR Image Construction and Image Processing  References Burks J, Cook RA (2011) Beyond Squirer and Davis: rediscovering Ohio’s earthworks using geophysical remote sensing.

In addition, even in the case where structures are actually buried level plane in below a flat ground, variable velocity soils can make these structures appear at different reflection times on GPR radargrams. An example of this was shown in the simulation in Fig. 2.17 where strong velocity contrasts caused velocity pull-ups on horizontal features at depth. Standard imaging practices to make archaeological site plans from GPR, the simple flat time slices are the most commonly used imagery. One can imagine, that displaying a set of horizontal slices across a site, that if the targets of interest are recorded at different depths such as shown in Fig. 5.1, that any individual – thin horizontal time slices made across these kinds of radargrams would not completely image all the targets on any single image. Information on structures might be partially contained at different depths in the time slice dataset, making for connection of structures with different depth horizons difficult to visualize. In the unique case where the features have high contrast with surrounding reflections, isosurface rendering might be able to show a complete 3D image; and when projected from the top could give a more complete picture of all the important reflections at a site. These kinds of datasets however, are also far and few between in the GPR world, as target reflections are not always highly contrasted with surrounding reflections. Isosurface rendering of all the important reflections surfaces with depth can not be used to effectively illuminate the complete structure when the targets do not have uniformly high contrast with the matrix of recorded background reflections. Most GPR datasets in archaeology have a multitude of reflections strengths where subtle to mid range reflection features need to be included in a complete image in order to solve subsurface image problems. As simple isosurface renders D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_5, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  101   102  5 Overlay Analysis  Fig. 5.1 A depiction of making a thin time slice across a radargram. Typical time slice implementation misses incorporating important reflections from upper and lower depth levels  are usually insufficient in summarizing all the subsurface features recorded in a single image, some way to present all the vital information in a 2d image is needed. One might suggest that taking a thick time slice might completely solve a subsurface imaging problem. However in these operations, unwanted reflections are incorporated and if the pulses were not adequately gained, some portions of the recorded scan will overweight other portions on thick time slicing. A single thick time slice made from large spatial time window often will not give the most useful presentation of the pertinent ground reflection anomalies buried over the entire depth horizon. A method introduced over a 15 years ago to synthesize all the important GPR reflections and place these into a comprehensive 2d image that are contained within the entire depth range has been extensively used to image burial mounds in Japan. The method is called “overlay analysis” (Goodman et al. 2006). In overlay analysis, individual time slice levels are independently weighted, colorized, and then overlays of the relative-strongest-reflectors are synthesized into a single 2d map, containing all the relevant reflector levels desired by the interpreter. The overlay of the relative-strongest-reflector can also be more simply stated that the strongest pixel in color trumps the weaker pixels from the collection of time slices used in the overlay. The process is a binary process in that transparent addition or pixel addition between the various depth slices are not employed – only the strongest pixel is displayed and preserved in the overlay process. Overlay analysis is shown to be the single most useful display option for synthesizing information at different portions of the GPR depth record, and placing the multi-level information into a single map for interpretation. The analysis has been applied in the discovery of many destroyed structures at the Japanese Imperial Family Tombs in Miyazaki prefecture (Goodman et al. 2009) and recently for surveys made at Native Indian pit houses villages at the Biesterfeldt site in North Dakota (Dalan et al. 2011). The successful discoveries at these sites, and many others, dictates the need for interpreters to interact with their data in combining information from different levels, as examination of simple separated 2d time slices are often not sufficient to solve subsurface imaging problems.   5.1 Introduction: via Application to the Biesterfeldt Site, North Dakota  103  The key steps in overlay analysis (Goodman et al. 2006, 2009) are: • Generating time slices of amplitude energy (squared amplitude) or Hilbert transformed pulses. • Choosing a range or individual time slices where pertinent information is contained. • Weighting each individual time slice with a unique color transforms. • Overlaying the relative-strongest-reflectors normalized from each time slice level. Time slices of GPR reflections are normally taken over a spatial time window that is usually one to two microwave pulse lengths. Thinner time slices can also be used in overlay analysis however, in this instance the Hilbert transform of the pulse radargrams is usually recommended prior to making sub-wavelength slices. The Hilbert transform or the squared amplitude energy insures that the pulses are rectified signals – non bipolar – and represent regions of positive weak to positive strong reflections. The second ingredient in overlay analysis is to include the range of desired time slices that are to be included in the process. Often shallower time slices can be removed from the mix in overlay analysis since unwanted surface reflections may hide deeper reflection. In addition, lower level data can be discarded in the analysis, as well as intermediate levels which do not have useful slice information. The analysis is completely flexible and non-consecutive levels, and any number of individual slices can be chosen in the analysis. In a later application we will see that the method is also not limited to combining data from a single antenna; multiple antenna datasets with different antenna frequencies on the same site can be included in overlay analysis. The third component in overlay analysis which separates this technique from simply making large-single thick time slices is the individualized weighting of reflections from each map. Each depth slice is normalized with its own unique colorization following the data histogram as a first application. Using any multiple of the standard deviation to set hi and lo cut (de-spiking) thresholds, as well as applying unique transform shapes over the reflection histogram, the maps can be independently colorized and weighted. Auto-gaining of the time slice grids is where color balancing of each level is made independently. The final step in the analysis is too graphically overlay all the time slices which have independent color transforms applied. The method can be likened to the “strongest pixels wins” over previously plotted pixels as the depth slices are overlaid. The analysis can be displayed in the form of an animation in which progressive overlays of the relative-strongest-reflectors are consecutively added onto the master overlay map. To visualize the process of overlay analysis, an example of a successful implementation of the method is done for the Biesterfeldt site in North Dakota. The results of this study are in part published by Dalan et al. (2011). The Biesterfeldt site is an abandoned Indian village site from the eleventh century that was adorned with closely spaced pit house dwellings (Fig. 5.2). Indian pithouses at this site were   104  5 Overlay Analysis  Fig. 5.2 The Biesterfeldt site in North Dakota (After Dalan et al. 2011)  constructed by digging round pits and building a roof over the pit that was supported by four large timber posts arranged in a square pattern. The remnant features to detect are the outlines of the pithouse but also to see if the postholes within the floor can be imaged. Other features such as storage pits, fire hearths or entrances into the pithouse are also important features to detect if they are present. GPR profiles were collected on one pithouse at 25 cm intervals using a 500 MHz antenna (as part of Steve DeVores’ National Park Service, Archaeological Geophysics Workshop). The typical set of individual time slices generated for this archaeological site is shown in Fig. 5.3. The time slices were computed at 5 ns intervals with about a 2 ns overlap between adjacent slices. On the shallowest time slice, the location of pit house number 20 is easily identified by a round reflection anomaly near (980,950)m. (House pit #21 is not imaged very well however). The are some isolated anomalies in the top slice showing the outline of the pit, however, no continuous set of reflections that might indicate internal structures such as four postholes for the central roof support are indicated. Deeper records in the time slice dataset may contain other important reflectors which are not at the same time/depth reflection. It would be beneficial to preserve all the colors in the first map as the outline of the pit is well defined and then to only add the stronger reflections at   105  Fig. 5.3 (continued)  5.1 Introduction: via Application to the Biesterfeldt Site, North Dakota   Fig. 5.3 Time slices generated for the Biesterfeldt site. The original set of slices at the top have a simple linear color transform applied: the bottom set of slices has a square root color transform applied to grids 2–9, giving more contrast and distinguishing just the stronger reflections at depth  106 5 Overlay Analysis   5.1 Introduction: via Application to the Biesterfeldt Site, North Dakota  107  deeper depths. Overlay analysis is flexible in that any colorized maps can be combined. By slightly changing the color transforms for all the lower maps 2–9 (using a square root transform which under-weights the colors), only the stronger reflectors are preferentially enhanced with mid-range to lower level reflection being suppressed (bottom set of images in Fig. 5.3). Using this bottom set of images, the process of overlay analysis can be easily visualized in Fig. 5.4. In overlay analysis in the way it is implemented, the first time slice presented is completely illuminated – e.g. all the pixels are shown. In the next time slice, only those pixels that are stronger than the first map are identified. Likewise, in the third map, only those pixels that are stronger in color than the second and first map are shown. In continuing, only those pixels shown in the nineth map are those areas at the site which have reflections that are stronger than all the shallower images. Note, that we are mostly speaking in terms of color since the key to overlay analysis is that the maps are independently colorized. This is important since the maps are not dependent on the gain curves applied to the raw pulses – each level is equally weighted in terms of its own color transform. The individual components in the overlay analysis are placed onto a single image (Fig. 5.5) as this has the potential to synthesize all the important targets at different levels into a comprehensive 2d image that is more valuable for interpretation. For the Biesterfeldt site, pithouse 20 is clearly seen but additionally, lower and stronger reflections from the deeper maps are integrated. Removal of the lower and mid range reflections from maps 2–9 preserves the important pithouse feature as the entire overlay process is completed. The complete overlay image shows the outline of the round pithouse features but also shows four distinct reflections within the pithouse that may be postholes. In addition, some other distinct reflections inside the pithouse such as storage pits or fire hearths are discovered. In overlay analysis, some interpreters might contend that overlay analysis is simply like taking a very thick slice of the site. This is not true. The reason being is that overlay analysis is not sensitive to the arbitrary gain curve which may be applied to amplify the pulses. Each level in the time slice record is independently gained and has its own colorization. To emulate this point a comparison of a thick time slice from 0 to 28 ns (top diagram) is compared with the overlay analysis time slice in Fig. 5.6 (middle diagram). The thick time slice shows almost no indication of the round pithouse. This feature is preserved in the overlay analysis since this top map was over weighted with respect to the lower maps which had overall weaker colorization applied to only indicate the strongest reflections at these lower levels. The flexibility of overlay analysis to remove any particular level in the process, allows the interpreter to take out layers that are hiding reflection features of interest. If the same overlay analysis map shown in the middle diagram in Fig. 5.6 is reprocessed to remove the third time slice from 6 to 11 ns, the resulting image shown on the bottom of the figures shows four potential posthole reflections much clearer. At the 6–11 ns map a stronger and slightly broader reflection partially masks the southernmost reflection that is attributed to a posthole. Removing all the reflection contribution at this level provides an even more complete picture of   Fig. 5.4 Maps showing the overlay components of the relative-strongest-reflectors from each of the individual time slice in Fig. 5.2 that are incorporated into the final master overlay  108 5 Overlay Analysis   5.1 Introduction: via Application to the Biesterfeldt Site, North Dakota  109  Fig. 5.5 Overlay analysis of the Biesterfeldt site shows all the strong reflections from 0 to 28 ns included on a single 2d image. An interpretation of four anomalies within the pithouse may indicate the location of the four postholes supporting the roof. An example pithouse photograph and an excavation at one nearby pithouse is North Dakota (Dalan et al. 2011) is shown for comparison  the possible structures of interest. The large strong reflection removed within the pithouse by selectively taking out level 3 in the overlay analysis, which may be a fire hearth or storage pit inside the pithouse, shows the bottommost posthole much clearer in the final overlay image. Adjusting the levels in the overlay analysis shows the potential of the method to better help to solve subsurface imaging problems. In this case, generating a map with four postholes supporting the roof on the pithouse could be synthesized using the desired time slice levels in the dataset. The overlay analysis method however does dictate the need to be “creative” and not just to assume that a continuity of time slice level overlays is all that is needed. The method requires user interaction to make the most of data contained at different levels in the time slice dataset. Finding the best combination of levels and the colorization applied to the levels suggest that an iterative process may be necessary should GPR investigators want to make the most of searching their data for revealing hidden structures.   110  5 Overlay Analysis  Fig. 5.6 Comparison of a thick time slice (0–28 ns) with overlay analysis. In the bottom overlay analysis image, the color transforms of time slices 2–9 are underweighted using a square transform. This enhances the stronger reflectors and weakens the mid-range and weaker reflectors so that they are less influential in the overlay analysis mix. The bottom diagram is similar to overlay analysis shown in the middle diagram – but without the third time slice from 6 to 11 ns included. One partially hidden posthole is revealed in the bottom map near (986,947)m by selectively removing this third time slice level from the master overlay   5.2 Discovery at the Japanese Imperial Family Tombs in Miyazaki Prefecture  5.2  111  Discovery at the Japanese Imperial Family Tombs in Miyazaki Prefecture  With contributions from Hongo Hiromichi and Higashi Noriaki, Saitobaru Archaeological Musuem, Yasushi Nishimura, Nara National Cultural Properties Research Institute, Japan Overlay analysis was applied in the discovery of destroyed structures of the largest kofun burials on the island of Kyushu. Osaho and Mesaho kofun burial mounds were designated important burials and they became part of the Imperial Family Tombs in 1895 (Figs. 5.7 and 5.8). Modern folklore suggests that Osaho and Mesaho are believed to be the burials of the grandparents of the first emperor of Japan, although no written documents from the time of the entombments on these mounds survives. The mounds are over 200 m in length and 20 m tall and are located in a protected burial mound park in Saitobaru National Burial Mounds in Miyazaki Prefecture. The Mesaho mound, believed to be the grandmother and Osaho the grandfather burial, has undergone little change in over 1,500 years since its construction. The Osaho kofun burial however, has had some reconstruction or alteration on the bottom part of the mound. Examination of the topographic map of the site shows a long protruding bottom. The western flank corner of the shell bottom appears not to be present, making the triangular bottom somewhat asymmetrical. Archaeologists on the site believe that portions of the western flank must have been altered sometime in the past. Some historical records suggest that archery practice in the Edo period which was commonly done adjacent to large burials. The ancient trainees may have removed material from part of the mound to build the long topographic ridge like embankment seen protruding from the bottom of the mound, to stop the flight of their arrows. The purpose of the GPR survey was to see if the ancient moat and tomb bottom that once surrounded Osaho kofun could be rediscovered. The hope would be that GPR could illuminate some remnant soil feature that might indicate the original shape of the tomb bottom, and help solve the mystery of whether a long or short triangular bottom once existed (Fig. 5.9). This survey was the first ever geophysical survey of any kind that would be authorized for investigating any Japanese Imperial Family cultural property. The survey was broken up into three field seasons from 2005 to 2007 and involved acquiring GPR data with both a 500 MHz (Fig. 5.10) antenna as well as a lower frequency 200 MHz antenna across the site. The individual depth slices did not contain reflection features showing anything close to resembling a triangular shape for the Kofun bottom. The final image that solved the subsurface secret was generated from overlay analysis in which the 500 MHz and 200 MHz data were used, and included overlaying all the relative-strongestreflections generated between 57 and 360 cm below the ground surface that existed on 135 individual time slice maps. The top surface data was eliminated from the mix of the final images since this data contained many surface and shallow information which hid the deeper reflection information. It was clear from the   112  Fig. 5.7 Artist rendition of the Saitobaru Kofun Burial Mounds in Miyazaki, Japan. The two largest, Osaho and Mesaho burial mounds are from the fifth century and belong to the Imperial Family (Courtesy of Toppan Printing Co.

Archaeologists interpreting the results believe that the mound was a   114  5 Overlay Analysis  Fig. 5.11 In this diagram the results from GPR surveying with the 500 and 200 MHz data are synthesized into an overlay time slice of all relative strongest reflections recorded from 57 to 360 cm. The yellow colors correspond to relatively strong reflections and the light gray to the relatively weakest reflections recorded. The image with interpretation indicates that a triangular shaped bottom can still be detected from remnant soil features present beneath the Osaho mound. This conclusion debunks earlier beliefs that the protruding portion of the mound bottom is probably not original construction, but occurred after the initial construction during the Kofun period  scallop (short keyhole) shaped mound based on the synthesized GPR subsurface images generated from overlay analysis for the site. Overlay analysis was successful in discovering minor mounds in front of the Imperial Family Tombs that were destroyed by ancient and modern farming as well as buied by volcanic activity in the area. Shown in Fig. 5.12 is the Saito-East mound. The site was excavated prior to the GPR survey. The excavation was not convincing that burial moats were explicitly seen and for this reason a follow-up GPR survey around the excavations was ordered. One area was excavated with three crossing trenches and another region to the west of this was also excavated but no evidence that destroyed burials existed at all could be detailed in the trenches. GPR time slices were made but no evidence of circular burial moats could also be found in the thin slice images until overlay analysis was applied to the data. The range of time slices from just below the ground surface to a depth of 45 ns was   5.2 Discovery at the Japanese Imperial Family Tombs in Miyazaki Prefecture  115  Fig. 5.12 Overlay analysis was instrumental in verifying the existence of two destroyed Kofun burial mounds that flank the Imperial Family Tombs – Osaho and Mesaho. One of the mounds was reconstructed based on the GPR survey and the results obtained from of overlay analysis (shown in blue in Fig. 5.7). Because the mound flanks the Osaho and Mesaho mounds, their rediscovery will be important to the complete understanding of the burial complex at Saitobaru   116  5 Overlay Analysis  included in the overlay analysis. Two round moats were clearly defined in the comprehensive images made on the site. One of the mounds was reconstructed and its location shown in Fig. 5.7. These guardian or ceremonial mounds may have served some purpose and are believed to be related to the Imperial Family tombs which they closely flank. The discovery of these mounds is a good example when geophysical prospecting was superior to results that could be extracted from excavation. These results also reinforce the case for proponents that believe important sites should have geophysical data recorded prior to destructive excavation.  5.3  Discovery at the Nanao Castle Site, Ishikawa Prefecture Japan  Another example of successful implementation of the overlay analysis was for the Nanao Castle site in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan (Fig. 5.13). This site is a medieval castle where all the buildings are completely destroyed. Castle walls and ramparts though can still be seen on the upper terraces. GPR surveys were conducted at 25 cm profile spacing on top of the highest terrace. Some features are believed to be shallowly buried at the site so a denser survey would be needed in order to not skip any features that might not fall within the cone of the beam of the antenna. Shown in Fig. 5.13 is the overlay analysis image manufactured using a total of 96 time slice made from 0 to 142 cm depth and with individual thicknesses of 12 cm. A 50 % overlap between adjacent time slices was made. The overlay image shows four strong isolated and equally spaced small reflections. The spacing of these reflections, at 1.8 m probably indicates that these are base stones for wood pillar supports of buildings that once existed on the site. This interval between pillars was – and still is – a common distance between vertical supports in castle and also temple structures in Japan. The utility of the overlay analysis method is that the context of shallower and important reflectors can be seen as deeper reflectors are added onto the developing image. Viewing the overlay analysis image as it is developing and particularly in an animation, can better serve in the interpretation of all the relevant reflections. Shown in Fig. 5.14 are examples of several intermediate images from overlay analysis. For the Nanao Castle GPR reflections indentified as a well, base stones, and foundation trenches can be interpreted as the full overlay image is compiled. The most striking revelation obtained from the overlay analysis, is that four evenly spaced base stones could be identified and only completely appear after about the 17th time slice was overlaid. Often, even if reflectors are at the same depths, there can be “obscuring elements” in the near surface that can degrade the primary reflections, such that these objects may appear deeper in the GPR section. Whatever, the case may be, overlay analysis has the potential to capture all these reflections and nicely place them into a convenient 2d image for interpretative   5.3 Discovery at the Nanao Castle Site, Ishikawa Prefecture Japan  117  Fig. 5.13 Overlay analysis (top diagram) constructed from a total of 96 time slice grids for the Nanao Castle site in Ishikawa Prefecture.

For instance, archaeological sites that were once built on level ground but have since been subject to variable deposition and thus have variable surface topography, may need to have time/ depth slice images created at level elevations across the data to properly reveal the subsurface structures. Goodman et al. (1995) made level plane depth slices across the Spiro House mound sites in Oklahoma. The level plane slices revealed square pithouse floor foundations from Native American Indians which only show up on (horizontal) slices made from topography adjusted radargrams. Standard topographic adjustments to the GPR involve assuming a velocity model for the radargrams, and then shifting the scans vertically to account for the change in topography (Tanaka et al. 2009). Some problems with this method, such as the “peeling effect” caused by differential slicing across the strong ground wave reflection can occur. An effective method to completely remove the peeling effect without having to apply drastic measures such as background filtering to remove the groundwave is possible. The method involves generating a volume from time slices that are independently normalized at each level and then graphically warping these volumes into their topography. Topographically adjusted volumes can then be sliced level plane without any influence of strong ground wave reflection. The details of this method are presented in the section on Level Plane Time Slices in this chapter. The standard method for simply shifting radar scans vertically to account for elevation variations along the profile is usually sufficient for sites with mild topography. However, in instances where the topographic variations are large the standard method for adjusting for elevation changes becomes less accurate. Some important improvements to GPR surveys over sites with topography was introduced by Goodman et al. (2006) when the in-line tilt of the antenna was incorporated into the static correction process. As tiltmeters were not being used in this earlier study, the antenna orientation on the topographic surfaces were assumed to be flush with the ground. The in-line tilt of the antenna could then be estimated from the topographic profile, and corrections applied to the radargrams to account for change D. Goodman and S.

A section on correction for tilt of the antenna is introduced in this chapter. Recently, tiltmeters have been placed onto GPR equipment and the real-time vector orientation of the antenna on the topographic surface is being recorded and synced with the scans (such as is being done at Dept of Geology/Geophysics at McMaster University, Canada – no published reference currently available). Vector imaging is the most general analysis for accounting for the 3D orientation of the antenna box and properly projecting the scans into their true 3d location. Vector imaging works not only for topographic surveys, but can be effectively applied to GPR surveys over any non-level structure such as tunnels. A section in this chapter – vector imaging – where changes in all axis orientations of the antenna accounting for the yaw, pitch and roll is introduced.  6.1  Survey Field Methods  The most difficult situation for GPR surveying on sites with topography is to record the correct navigation and to have it properly synced to the collection of digitized radar scans. The navigation requirement when surveying topographic structures such as mounded tombs (Fig. 6.1) is that a flat plane projection location of the survey lines is required with the location of the scans known on the site. For this reason, automatic survey wheel markers that place a specified number of scans/unit distance is insufficient for giving the flat plane projected locations. The distance over the mounded structure would be triggered by the distance surveyed over the topographic profile of the site and not be the flat plane projected locations that are required. Based on the known topography of the site, the survey wheel data could be re-located post processing, however, uncertainties in the actual topographic profile could infiltrate these re-calculated positions. Several methods employed in the past and present can be used to accomplish the goal of obtaining flat plane projected locations of the radar profiles when total station recordings or GPS navigation is not available. In one method practiced in the past, the radargram scans are positioned with user inserted markers to sync the recorded scans with known locations on the ground. Measuring tapes are placed over the topographic structures and are kept level. The survey tape ends will be attached to poles and the tape kept as tight as possible so that they do not droop on the site. The surveyor will then place user inserted markers into the radargrams as meter markings are passed on the tape with the antenna. Survey lines recorded with this kind of navigation data can usually give reasonably enough accuracy for making subsurface images. GPR control units in this method of data collection are set to time – and not distance – modes where the radar signals are constantly being sent out of the antenna by a certain number of scans/s. This navigation method to place a tape that is kept level across a topographic structure can work on sites with mild elevation, but will not work effectively on sites when more than 2–3 m of topography are present. Another method to get the correct locations of the radar scans onto the site is to lay out an array of parallel and perpendicular tapes on a site (Fig. 6.1). The intersections of the tapes represent local   6.2 Standard Topographic Correction  121  Fig. 6.1 Topographic surveying over mounded tomb #202 at the Saitobaru Burial Mound Park. Cross tape intersections are used for placing manual navigation markers in the radar scans (Photo of GPR survey by Higashi Noriaki, Curator at the Saitobaru Archaeological Museum, Miyazaki, Japan)  x and y flat plane projected locations across the site. The surveyor in this instance will place markers in the radar scans at every intersection encountered between the cross tapes. This method will give the most accurate measurement achievable without external navigation systems. Total station provides the most accurate navigation when real time positioning can be recorded and synced with the radar scans. The laser set up though can often be problematic if significant topography is present and direct lines of sight cannot be obtained. GPS can also be used if above ground obstructions are minimal such as from nearby trees or ground obstacles do not cause multipath positioning errors. Some errors with GPS or total station can still occur when even the highest degree of positioning is available since the tilt of the pole supporting the GPS or total station reflector can be several tens of centimeters off the center of antenna when surveying on steeper slopes of the sites. Unless there is some active measurements to account for the tilt of the equipment above the antenna, additional navigation noises can infiltrate the position information.  6.2  Standard Topographic Correction  To adjust GPR radargrams for topography, the velocity model of the site needs to be determined. Most adjustments assume a nominal velocity across the site, although multi-dimensional velocity models can be used if this information is known or constructed. Using a nominal velocity of the site usually found via hyperbola matching, the radar scans can be adjusted for elevation changes. The radargrams can either be graphically warped to match the elevation changes, or new binary   122  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.2 Standard topographic corrections of a radargrams collected over Kofun Burial #111. Recorded scans are simply shifted vertically to account for the local elevation change. (Geophysical Archaeometry Laboratory Report 1996, GPR Survey of Kofun Burial Mound #100, Dept of Education, Miyazaki Prefecture). The roof of a subterranean chamber was imaged a few meters below the ground surface (Fig. 6.6)  radargrams can be generated which have the elevation accounted for in the topography adjusted profiles. In the case when new binary radargrams are written, care is usually taken to preserve the original dynamic resolution in the digitized pulses by converting the topographic elevation to equivalent digitized scan samples. Shown in Fig. 6.2 are radargrams collected (at Kofun burial mound #100, Saitobaru Burial Mound Park) that have been binary corrected for elevation changes along the profiles. These results used a velocity 6 cm/ns found from hyperbola fitting for the soils at the site which are primarily highly resistive volcanic ash. The deep reflection seen on the front radargram in the image is the ceiling of a subterranean burial chamber that housed the remains of a military commander from the fifth century.  6.3  Tilt Correction  For sites with mild topography simple shifting of the GPR scans to account for elevation changes is a reasonable first approximation placing the radar scans in their proper spatial position. However, in the case when the topography is not mild, the simple standard method of shifting radar scan can deviate significantly from their   6.3 Tilt Correction  123  Fig. 6.3 Surveying of a burial mound showing the dramatic change in attitude that can occur with GPR antenna  true corrected positions. The photograph in Fig. 6.3 shows a mounded tomb site where typical radargram profiles can be collected over. The attitude of the antenna can vary significantly from the horizontal on sites with topography which will cause the main vertical beam of the antenna to be significantly tilted. Static corrections of radargrams which account for the tilt that the GPR antenna encounters on sites with topography were developed (Goodman et al. 2006). The corrections used in these earlier studies examined adjusting the radargrams for tilt only in the antenna in-line direction. Tilt corrected radargrams show that changes in the imaged locations of subsurface structures can be significant. Depending on the abruptness of the topography, there is the possibility of the vertical beam transmitted from the GPR antenna crossing over or intersecting the path of a nearby scan at depth. This condition, illustrated in Fig. 6.4, indicates that the crossover regions is a function of the degree of how fast the topography will change over distance as well as the maximum depth that the GPR survey is taken to. For mild topographic changes, no crossovers of the projected scans occur (top diagram in Fig. 6.4) but scan crossovers on sites with stronger topographic variations can happen (bottom diagram in Fig. 6.4). Tilt analysis was implemented using static correction options in GPR-SLICE Software. Special operations are required to correct for tilt depending upon the spatial density of recorded radar scans. The normal projection of the scan is determined from a local change in elevation at the scan to be adjusted. The tilt of the scan can be estimated by a simple slope calculation using the local topography profile at the recorded scan. Shown in Fig. 6.5 is a radargram where the scans are projected normal to the slope of the local topography. Gaps between adjacent scans   124  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.4 An diagram indicating how the scans recorded on GPR antenna on sites with topography get projected. In the case where topographic changes are abrupt, a condition where nearby (vertical emanating) radar scans actually can intersect/crossover previously recorded scan at depth can occur  can occur if the topography abruptly changes along the profile and if the scan density is not sufficient. One easy way to accommodate or fill in the gap is either to resample the radargram to a much higher number of scans, thus eliminating the chance of gaps occurring. Another possibility is to keep the original scan density recorded in the raw radargram and to sweep all the recorded scan over a small angle to fill in the gaps. For the example radargram shown at the top in Fig. 6.5, if the scans are swept over a small angle, all the gap regions in the binary corrected radargram can be filled in. The static correction analysis will also predict where “crossover” regions will happen. The software was programmed to simply allow the first radar scan that filled a binary void to be preserved. (It was found that averaging the pulse with its phase from additional pulses that might intersect a subsurface cell, could diminish the quality of the dataset. Mathematical addition of out-of-phase reflections signals or small errors in the assumed positions of the antenna on the site tend to nullify pulse addition as a way to handle crossover regions effectively). To estimate the tilt the GPR antenna encounters over a site with topography, the first derivative of the ground slope is computed. This slope is used to project the normal ray emanating from the tilted antenna. The horizontal distance the rays travel from the antenna when it is tilted, is a function of the microwave velocity. The horizontal distance d that a ray travels from the antenna is given by d ¼ sin(tilt)*v*t/2 where tilt is the angle the antenna makes over the topography, v is the velocity and t is the travel time. The standard topographic corrections essentially assume that d is 0, e.g. there is either no tilt and/or the velocity in the horizontal direction is 0 (Fig. 6.5, top diagram). If the tilt is not taken to be 0, the horizontal distance the ray travels must be accounted for as a function of the microwave velocity at the site. Shown in the middle diagram in Fig. 6.5 is the same radargram corrected for tilt using a microwave velocity of 6 cm/ns. For comparison, assuming a much higher velocity of 12 cm/ns for the site, areas of crossover regions can be seen (in the bottom diagram, Fig. 6.5). The actual best fit velocity of 7 cm/ns found from hyperbola fitting is used to make tilt corrections shown with an excavation photograph of the site (Fig. 6.6). The subterranean chamber imaged   6.3 Tilt Correction  125  Fig. 6.5 Comparison of tilt correction for a single radargram using assumed velocities of 0, 6, and 12 cm/ns.

The areal extent of the subterranean burial chamber is closer to the true dimension after tilt corrections are implemented. Photograph of an excavation along a portion of the displayed profile. At the time of the photograph during excavation, a special resin was being placed in the inner portion of the chamber to recreate this structure inside the site museum (Photo courtesy of Hongo Hiromichi and Higashi Noriaki, Saitobaru Archaeological Museum, Miyazaki, Japan)  on the radargram is shown to have a much shorter reflection signature after in-line tilt corrections are applied to the radargram. The subsurface chamber housed artifacts from an ancient military burial. It should be noted that the data when they are migrated in archaeological applications and when velocities and navigation are accurately known requires more extensive care as migrator templates can be significantly altered. Lack of knowledge of the velocity field as well as typical navigational uncertainties, significantly decrease the validity of implementing topographic migration. In our applications, when migration was implemented, we assumed the elevation was reasonable flat over that localized range. This assumption is invalid though when topography is steeply changing and the migrator template must also account for topography. More improvements are left to be made on sites with severe topographic changes (Sassen and Creasman 2012). Another difference between standard topographically adjusted radargrams and tilt corrected radargrams is that a gap can exist at the ends of tilt corrected radargrams. An example is shown for Ikime Kofun #7 burial mound in Miyazaki   6.4 Level Plane Time Slices  127  Fig. 6.7 Comparison of a standard topography correction and a tilt corrected radargram for Ikime Kofun Burial Mound #7. Gaps on the edges of tilt corrected radargrams can exist  City (Fig. 6.7). For the tilt correction there can be a wedge of data on the sides of the radargram where no projected radar scans exist. Protruding wedges at the ends of radargrams where the topographic slope is upward can also occur at the ends of lines. It should be noted that reflection anomalies beneath profiled locations where steep slopes are present, may shift several meters from the apparent location when comparing with uncorrected – standard topographically corrected radargrams.  6.4  Level Plane Time Slices  Often, it is advantageous to have images showing subsurface reflections that are at the same constant elevation in the ground. Time slices made at the same depth in the ground, irrespective of what the local topographic variation exists, are called “level plane” depth slices (Goodman et al. 1995; Conyers and Goodman 1997). One of the   Fig. 6.8 Level plane time slice made from binary radargrams corrected for topography for Ikime Kofun Burial Mound #7  128 6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging   6.4 Level Plane Time Slices  129  Fig. 6.9 Comparison of tilt corrected and uncorrected depth slices (6.5 m) for Ikime Kofun Burial Mound #7 (Miyazaki, Japan). A shift in the location of the identified burial chamber of almost 2 m is occurs in the slice made from tilt corrected radargrams. Subsequent excavation pictures and site plans indicate a filled burial chamber that roughly matches the general size and location given on the tilt corrected time slice map. One corridor leading into the main burial chamber was excavated, and an adjacent tunnel burial (yokoana) was also discovered during later excavations (After Goodman et al. 2006)  first applications of level plane depth slicing was implemented at the Spiro House Mounds site in Oklahoma. Time slices that were uncorrected for topography were unable to show square house floor from an Indian house mound site; whereas the level plane depth slices show nearly perfect subsurface images of the square walls and floors of burnt adobe house foundations (Goodman et al. 1995). Level plane slices are shown for the Ikime Kofun Burial Mound #7 for radargrams corrected for the tilt of the antenna (Fig. 6.8). The burial mound is a keyhole shaped mound from the fifth century (Fig. 6.9). The time slices show reflection anomalies made across equal elevations from within the burial mound. A comparison of one level plane depth slice made from standard topographic correction and one generated from slicing tilt corrected radargrams is shown in   130  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.10 An isosurface rendering of the 70 % strongest reflecting surface in the 3D data cube, shows the general shape of the subterranean chamber built into the side of the Ikime Kofun Burial Mound #7  Fig. 6.9. For this particular site, a square-like anomaly is recorded from the ceiling of a subsurface burial chamber that was filled with volcanic soils. The chamber is about 2m closer to the central axis of the burial mound as measured on the tilt corrected time slice. Comparison with the standard topographic time slice, the location of the chamber is mapped 2m further away from the central burial mound axis and is obviously not in the correct position. For this example, the flanks of the burial mound were quite steep – approximately 35  – and accounts for the significant movement of the chamber to its correct subsurface position. The subterranean burial chamber (chikashiki in Japanese) for this particular burial mound is also shown to be well defined in isosurface rendering of the 70 % strongest reflecting surface in the 3d data cube. (Fig. 6.10). A corridor chamber – yokoana – is also seen in the rendering. The strong reflections on the top surface of the site probably indicate locations where stones are preserved. Burial mounds in this era were often completely adorned with surface stones. During excavations many of the top stones that had fallen from the elevated regions on the mound were discovered in excavation trenches made across the surrounding moat. One interesting feature that could be seen in a level plane time slice made across the burial mound is believed to have some a relationship to the sequence of mound building events. Shown in Fig. 6.11 is a level plane time slice that is shown with an interpretation of a subtle square like soil feature that was mapped on the round top of the mound. The rounded keyhole shaped mounds are believed to have been built in several steps. In the first operation the rounded upper part may have initially been constructed with a rotated square aligned along the axis to form a diamond. After this construction, soil material would be added to the sides to form a rounded upper   6.4 Level Plane Time Slices  131  Fig. 6.11 Interpretation of subtle square-like anomaly on the top portion of the Ikime Kofun Burial #7 is shown along with the proposed construction episodes  top of the mound. The initially hard packed material in the construction of the rotated square may have been made with slightly different soil materials which could have been preserved at the site. The GPR was able to detect these slight soil changes and to distinguish different building construction events. Similar kinds of images have been seen on many other mound surveys in Japan (Geophysical Archaeometry Laboratory, University of Miami Japan Division reports and internal reports from Tenri University). One of the interesting issues with making level slices from topographically corrected radargrams are that a “peeling effect” can be seen on shallow time slices (e.g. Fig. 6.8, slices 1–9). On the edges of the time slices, which parallel the topographic contours of the site -strong reflections that outline the topographic contour can be seen. This is caused by slices that have just encountered the groundwave of the topographically corrected radargrams. Initially only the first rising portion of the ground wave is partially encountered and thus the outermost reflection is relatively weak (as shown in blue for the color table used). Just inside this as the full slicing of the groundwave is being done the strong groundwave causes the color just within the outside flanks to flicker to the strongest (red) colorization. As slices are made below the groundwave, the outside peeling effect on the shallow slices dies out in the deeper slices (Fig. 6.8, > slice 10). This effect caused by undulations of the ground wave with variable topography, are not seen in   132  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  the data with the level plane depth slices when the slicing is completely below the ground wave reflection. The peeling effect can be partially eliminated or fully eliminated in several ways. One quick and easy method is simply to apply background filtering to the radargrams prior to making tilt corrected radargrams. With the ground wave removed, the level plane slices without the dominant peeling effect can be generated. An example is applied to Saitobaru Kofun Burial #202 (shown in photograph Figs. 6.1 and 6.12). Level plane slices of unfiltered radargrams that are adjusted for topography are shown in the top row along with level plane slices made from background filtered and topographically adjusted radargrams. The influence of the groundwave and the peeling effect is drastically reduced, but not completely, by operating on the background filtered radargrams. The background filtering though could have drastic effects if long linear features are parallel to the radargrams profiles. In this instance removal of important reflection features could occur. A more powerful method to remove the peeling effect is included in the next section on topographical warping.  6.5  Topographic Imaging on Mounded Tombs Through Graphical Warping  With contributions from Higashi Noriaki and Hongo Hiromichi, Saitobaru Archaeological Museum, Miyazaki, Japan An intrinsically more favorable method of topographic correction using graphical warping is presented. The standard methods discussed so far involve making topographically and binary corrected radargrams – followed by slicing these data to make depth slices. However, a more efficient method is to generate a rectangular of volume of GPR reflections that are comprised of individually and independently – normalized and colorized time slices. Time slicing by itself – is a form of background removal since only the changes within each level are being represented and not the absolute levels of the background reflection levels. Because of this, the ground wave reflections are not “illuminated” in volumes made from independently normalized levels which comprise the individual levels compiled to the 3d volume. The beauty in this method is that background filters need not be applied to the data! These filters often can remove important features in the data particularly if longerconstant reflection structures are recorded. However, the end benefit as well is that the peeling effect is not manifested in the 3d volume. Using a volume, where each level comprising the volume is independently normalized, does not overweight of the ground wave reflection in the topographically adjusted volume. Only the changes within the topographic volume and at each level are represented. An additional advantage of normalized slices is that each level shows the full range of reflections at that level, regardless of the absolute gain applied to the recorded radargrams pulses. Because the time/depth slice in itself acts as a background   Fig. 6.12 Comparison of level plane slices made from topographically adjusted radargrams (top row) and from topographically adjusted radargrams which were background filtered (Saitobaru Kofun #202). The peeling effect seen in the top slices, has been reduced in the level plane slices made from the background filtered dataset  6.5 Topographic Imaging on Mounded Tombs Through Graphical Warping 133   134  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.13 2D level plane slices made from processed radargrams that did not include background filtering. The peeling effect is not manifested in these level plane depth slices since the volume is generated from a series of normalized slices (Saitobaru Kofun #202)  removal filter, only changes at each level that is different from the “background” reflection is visualized in a normalized slice. An example of some 2d level plane depth slices made from graphical warping to match the topographic changes on the site is shown in Fig. 6.13. The data in the 3d volume are made from processed radargrams that do not include background filtering. Normalized depth slices from each level are used to generate the 3d volume – and thus the groundwave influence (as seen in Fig. 6.12) is not translated into the level plane slices. Shallow level plane slices at about 1.4m below the top of the mound indicate a roughly square-like anomaly that is identified as the burial pit (Fig. 6.14). The mounded tomb can also be visualized by examining the series of topography parallel slices made from the normalized volume (Fig. 6.15). The topography parallel images are generated by simply warping the data volume into its topography. The primary structures detectable on top of the Japanese kofun mounds with GPR are usually the burial pits as well as remains within the pits that may have survived. GPR imaging of Saitobaru Kofun #202 was successful in identifying the burial pit on the top of the keyhole shape mound. An isosurface rendering of the 80 % strongest reflector shows the general square outline of the burial pit (Fig. 6.16). The burial pits are usually dug several sizes larger than the coffins that were entombed there. The reason the burial pits are much larger than the coffins is to accommodate funerary ceremonies prior to covering of the coffin. The coffins, which were often made of wood have usually decayed. However, the central area within the larger burial pit was usually first lined with rocks or clay on a portion of the floor to secure coffin. The area identified between the burial pit walls are the burial remains and possibly the rock/clay line bottom that once supported the intact coffin is identified in the image. This interpretation with these subtle reflections could be made since burial mounds within the same construction period have been excavated and previously documented (Tsude 1987; Barnes 1991; Edwards and Okita 2006). On example of a   6.5 Topographic Imaging on Mounded Tombs Through Graphical Warping  135  Fig. 6.14 Three level planes slices at 1.13, 5.51, and 11.7 m elevations through Kofun Burial Mound #202, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. On the topmost level plane slice strong reflections here indicate the size of burial pit which encompasses more than half of the entire top portion area of the mound at this level  Fig. 6.15 Topography warped depth slice made at 1.19 m below the ground surface at Kofun Burial Mound #202, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan  mound that was surveyed with GPR and excavated is shown in Fig. 6.17. Kofun #13 had a rock line foundation that once supported a 7m long wooden coffin. The wood coffin was completely decayed except for funerary items that were preserved at various locations along the length of the burial that could be recovered. The rock   136  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.16 Isosurface rendering of the 85 % strongest reflecting – normalized surface for Kofun Burial Mound #202. Two sides of the main burial pit are identified as well as a central anomaly which may represent entombed remains or possibly rock/clay foundations floors to secure the ancient coffin  Fig. 6.17 GPR time slices made at Kofun Burial Mound #13 in Saitobaru. The rock lined foundation with clay was used to support a 7 m wooden coffin. The coffin was placed at angle to main axis of the burial mound and was in a N-S direction which was common for burials in the Kofun period. The site was excavated to the original size of the burial pit which encompasses nearly the entire top of the burial mound  lined burial could be seen clearly, and the burial pit, although less contrasted, could also be identified in the upper depth slices (Fig. 6.17).   6.6 Vector Imaging  137  Fig. 6.18 A survey where the real time pitch/yaw/roll of the antenna sensor are recorded simultaneously with the radargrams are being done for a research study on biomass by Dr. Joe Boyce and graduate student Michelle Mellon, Dept. of Geology, McMaster University, Canada. The radar scans are synced with the top mounted accelerometers using externally connected GPS for recording time stamps  6.6  Vector Imaging  Vector imaging is a new definition that we introduce as a name to describe GPR surveying on sites where the orientation of the antenna, in 3d space, is measured or determined for each radar scan recorded. The orientation of the antenna can either be designated by the pitch, yaw and roll angels or conveniently defined in vector space. The vector of the GPR antenna is generally not being measured yet on typical antennas today however, some research work is beginning to incorporate real time orientation measurements using three component accelerometers/gyros. Dr. Joe Boyce at the Dept. of Geology, McMaster University recently (summer of 2011) placed an accelerometer on the top of a GPR antenna so that the orientation of the antenna could be recorded and monitored real time with the radar scan recording (Fig. 6.18). The applications for projecting GPR data into their true 3d space based on accurate measurements of the orientation vector of the antenna could have wide applications as well as provide more accuracy in imaging. Infrastructure surveys such as on tunnels, vertical columns that are cylindrical or square or any non-flat surface surveys could highly benefit by projecting the GPR scans into their true 3d space when the vector of the antenna is simultaneously recorded along with the radar reflection pulses. Projecting the GPR data into its contextual spatial arrangement rather than simply showing data on flat 2d radargrams can better assist in the making accurate images for interpretation.   138  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.19 The vector normal to a (topographic) surface can be estimated by the cross product of any two local line vectors contained within the surface. The cross product of vectors defined by points 1–2 and 1–3 can be used to estimate the surface normal to project the radar scan  Improvements in imaging can be made in lieu of synced accelerometer data being widely employed and recorded simultaneously in the GPR survey. In the instance of GPR surveying being made on surfaces with known topography and assuming the GPR antenna is flush with these surfaces, the vector orientation of the GPR antenna in 3D space can be estimated. Leckebush and Reychener (2005) reoriented subsurface reflections on a site with topography and accounted for antenna orientation. By assuming the flat surface of the antenna is in perfect contact with the surface that is being surveyed, the determination of the surface normal of the topography can be used to give the orientation of the antenna. The measurements of the vector of the antenna in 3d space can be determined from nearby data points where the surface elevation and location are known. If three local points on the surface of a structure are: x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2 and x3,y3,z3 (as seen in Fig. 6.19), then the surface normal – the vector emanating perpendicular to the plane of that surface is given by the cross product of the differences between adjacent line vectors on the surface (Eq. 6.1): nx ¼ ða2  b3 Þ   ða3  b2 Þ ny ¼ ða3  b1 Þ   ða1  b3 Þ nz ¼ ð a1  b2 Þ   ð a2  b1 Þ where: a1 ¼ ðx2   x1 Þ b1 ¼ ðx3   x1 Þ  (6.1)   6.6 Vector Imaging  139  Fig. 6.20 Example of radargrams collected over a burial mound where the scans are projected into their true 3D orientation using the calculated surface normals of the topography  a2 ¼ ðy2   y1 Þ b2 ¼ ðy3   y1 Þ a3 ¼ ðz2   z1 Þ b3 ¼ ðz3   z1 Þ  The local points can be taken from surface data which might be located on a square grid of elevations. Once the surface normal vector nx, ny, nz are known the GPR scans can be projected into their true 3d space. An example of projecting the 2d radargrams into their 3d space by assuming the normal vector emanating downward from the ground surface on the topographic site, is shown in Fig. 6.20. The projected radar scans can also have similar “crossover” locations (described in the Tilt Correction section) when the topography is changing rapidly along the profile line. For this site because the topography is mild, crossovers are nearly nonexistent. The full corrections for yaw/pitch/roll of the antenna can be applied to generated volumes of sites with topography. Similar full 3d corrections in archaeological applications were done by Leckebusch and Rychener (2005). Shown in Fig. 6.21 are a comparison of time slices using standard topographic corrections along with level slices made from full vector corrections to the volume. The volume was generated from the same radargram dataset in Fig. 6.20 (which are from a burial mound site in Northern Europe). Four time slice levels in the volumes are presented. Near the top surface cuts little differences in the standard and vector adjusted volumes can be seen. Further at depth though, some reflection features are shifted or are “migrated” to be smaller or larger on the vector adjusted images. The vector corrected volume, depending on its initial density, can require interpolating   140  6 Imaging Over Sites with Topography and Vector Imaging  Fig. 6.21 Full 3d correction of a volume collected over a mound using vector adjustments is compared with standard topography corrections   References  141  Fig. 6.22 Radargram projected along the radial or the longitudinal length of a tunnel can be projected into their 3d orientation using vector imaging  gaps in the volume if cells are not filled after vector adjustments are made. For the volume used here, a simple nearest neighbor average was used to interpolate gaps in the vector adjusted volume. The vector adjusted radargrams can also compiled to a complete 3d file and then full 3d interpolation can be implemented. If this is implemented, it is usually better to work with Hilbert transform volumes as the accuracy of vector information and small navigation errors could limit the usefulness of pulse volumes.  6.7  Tunnel Imaging  Without synced real time measurements of the antenna orientation, vector imaging on some simple structures can nonetheless be implemented so that radar scans can be projected based on known surface geometry. An example for projecting both the radial and longitudinally collected tunnel radargrams is shown in Fig. 6.22. The vectors of the scans can easily be calculated for such simple structures. More complicated structures will either require great care in introducing the known geometry of the surface or to eventually employ real time measurements of the antenna orientation with accelerometers.

For this reason GPR has found a multitude of applications in studying the integrity of historical buildings (Barone et al. 2010; Cosentino et al. 2011; Kadioglu and Kadioglu 2010; Perez-Gracia et al. 2009; Sambuelli et al. 2011). GPR surveying can effectively identify critical structural supports such as rebar and tension ties in walls that help to constrain the horizontal load forces (Bartroli et al. 2011; Ranalli et al. 2004). After earthquakes or landslides the changes and hidden damage to structures can be detected using radar (Orlando 2007). In the case when GPR is used to monitor a building, recordings at time 1 and time 2 can be differenced to indicate only those areas which have undergone changes since the last survey. GPR imaging for evaluating building safety are common enough in 2012 that most geotechnical companies advertise this service on their websites. In this chapter the application of GPR on imaging of historical buildings is presented via several case studies made at important monuments in Puerto Rico. Expanded research work by Bartroli et al. (2011) has also been given special permission to be included in this chapter for mapping and evaluating the integrity of subsurface structures on buildings at the St Pau Historic Site in Barcelona, Spain. In addition, a special section on GPR surveys of stone bridges in Spain by Solla et al. (2010) and other researchers at the University of Vigo has been included.  7.1  San Juan Bautista Cathedral and the Iglesia San Jose Church, Puerto Rico  With contributions by Kent Schneider, US Forest Service and Agamemnon Pantel, Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico Several important buildings were studied in Puerto Rico to discover subsurface structures as well as to indicate areas of deterioration. The Cathedral of San Juan de Bautista began construction as early as 1521 and is regarded as the oldest building in D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_7, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  143   144  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.1 A time slice image made at a depth from 98 to 108 cm at the alter of the San Juan Bautista Cathedral in Puerto Rico. The large reflection anomaly below the alter is the crypt entrance of Juan Ponce de Leon who was the first governor of Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico and second oldest cathedral in the Western Hemisphere (Fig. 7.1). The remains of Juan Ponce de Leon, the first Governor of Puerto Rico who died while allegedly searching for the Fountain of Youth in Florida, are buried in the cathedral’s crypt. The cathedral also contains the remains of Carlos Manuel Rodriguez Santiago, who was the first Puerto Rican to be beatified by the Pope. At the San Juan Bautista Cathedral, the exact location of presumed crypts made in front of the alter were needed to be located prior to removing the tile. The GPR imaging could provide a method to outline these subterranean crypts and to alleviate the need to remove tiles not directly above the crypts stairwell entrance. A shallow time slice image made at the cathedral alter (Fig. 7.1) was constructed from parallel profile collected at a 9 in. spacing which is half distance of the ancient floor tiles. The strong/symmetric anomaly seen in the center of the image is the crypt entrance and represents reflections from the doors guarding the subterranean stairwells. The convent church of San José is considered to be one of the earliest religious structures built by the Spanish in the New World in the sixteenth century. The church and the convent are of enormous historical, architectural and religious significance at the local, regional and international levels. The Iglesia San Jose church is located within the original walled city of Old San Juan which became a UNESCO World Heritage site. The monastery and church complex display four centuries of architectural design and masonry traditions including extraordinary Isabelline Gothic vaults of Catalan double shell construction. The church was constructed and renovated over several hundred years from 1532 to 1735 by the   7.1 San Juan Bautista Cathedral and the Iglesia San Jose Church, Puerto Rico  145  Fig. 7.2 The main floor of the Iglesia San Jose church was surveyed with GPR to reveal subterranean crypts as well as to illuminate areas on the floor that are suffering from water infiltration. A crypt at the alter as well as two side crypts, one between the arches and in a side room were also imaged. The anomaly at the alter was the original crypt where Juan Ponce de Leon was entombed for 277 years until it was exhumed and placed at the San Juan Bautista Cathedral in 1836  Dominican Order as part of their Saint Aquinas monastery and was renamed by the Jesuits who took over the monastery in 1865. The remains of Juan Ponce de Le on were buried in the main alter crypt of the Iglesia San Jose church from 1559 to 1836, before being interred to the San Juan Bautista Cathedral. The Ponce de León coat of arms were not transferred and are still located near the main altar of the church. His grandson, Juan Ponce de Leon II is buried in the crypt beneath the Sanctuary’s floor as well as the famous Puerto Rican painter José Campeche. The Iglesia San Jose Church had undergone many renovations as a result of additions as well as repairs needed from earthquake damage. In addition to finding lost crypts, a GPR survey was also designed to assist in the determination of areas that are undergoing accelerated alteration from weathering. The church is under environmental siege as water infiltration caused by ancient or modified drainage on the site that is either blocked or broken has deteriorated walls and the main sanctuary floor. At the time of the survey the site was under the possibility of collapse and for this reason the entire complex had been closed to the public. A GPR survey of the main church floor shows several crypts quite clearly (Fig. 7.2). One crypt found between an arch leading into the main sanctuary was not known and could be easily rediscovered in the survey.   146  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.3 A high frequency (1.5 GHz) GPR survey at 5 cm line spacing was made along one wall of the Iglesia San Jose Church. The strong (yellow) reflections indicate areas where renovations or where stone headers may exist in the walls  The survey was also able to identify and verify water infiltration had affected the integrity of portions of unglazed floor tiles which have been damaged by water seepage (Fig. 7.2). The moist tiles can be discerned from the drier tiles as they have overall stronger reflections as the higher conductivity and a higher impedance caused by elevated water content, generates stronger electrical contrasts with the floor foundations. Connecting areas where remodels or additions to the original church structure were added also correlate with weakened areas that are suffering from accelerated deterioration. Some of the walls at the site have been surveyed with high frequency antennas (1.5 GHz) in order to determine the support structures. In one subsurface image where renovations are known to have been done, a front prayer room shows internal wall repairs or large stone headers near the sides of one of the stain glass windows (Fig. 7.3).  7.2  Sant Pau Historic Site, Barcelona, Spain  Contribution by Roger Sala Bartroli, Ekhine Garcia Garcia, and Robert Tamba, SOT (www.sotprospection.com) Modernist architects often used metallic supports in the construction of their buildings. The use of metallic beams was not initially deemed as a problematic building method. However, deterioration of the metal supports has an accelerated life cycle and can undermine the stability of these buildings. The problem is that the metallic beams are not accessible and it is not possible to service these with any protective material. Furthermore, the surrounding stones and bricks can accumulate   7.2 Sant Pau Historic Site, Barcelona, Spain  147  humidity, exposing the metallic elements to a highly aggressive environment which accelerates their deterioration. As a consequence, the metal supports can start to suffer fatigue from oxidation after just a few decades of existence. The Sant Pau Historic Site is a Catalan modernist complex in Barcelona built between 1902 and 1930. The site is one of the largest of the modernism period. Although the use of metallic elements was common at this time, its integration in complex architectural structures makes the specificity of the site. The design, by the Catalan Modernist architect Lluis Domenech i Muntaner, was declared as a World Heritage site by the UNESCO. After a 100 years as a fully functional hospital, the site is currently being renovated and will be used to host head offices of the United Nations and of the European Union as well as other institutions who work in the Mediterranean area in fields related to sustainability, education and health. For a better planning of the restoration works, a GPR survey was proposed. Both facades and vaults of the main buildings were explored in order to describe their internal structure and detect possible pathologies. the exploration of the facades, GPR profiles were collected at 5 cm transect spacing using a GSSI SIR-3000 radar system with a 900 MHz antenna along the south-eastern and north-eastern facades of the main building. The data were migrated and Hilbert transformed prior to generating time slices and 3D volumes. The profiles and time slice images indicate that the walls have a complex internal structure (Fig. 7.4). Areas with both metallic tension ties and air chambers can be clearly identified in the time slice images and in the isosurface renders. Several locations indicated weak reflection returns from the metallic tension ties on the north-eastern facade (Fig. 7.5). Openings at control points show that the northern facades suffered more oxidation problems which can be explained by a higher humidity due to less solar exposition. Areas with relatively little or no corrosion on the metalwork show continuous reflections strengths. The corroded tension ties show an attenuation in the strength of the signal. This attenuation can be explained by the presence of a transition area of high conductivity around the corroded tension ties. In addition, as these areas do not present sharp discontinuities, the diffuse discontinuity prevents strong reflected energy from being returned to the receiving antenna. For the exploration of the vaulted ceilings of the Sant Pau Historic Site, the GPR survey was achieved using an IDS RIS MF Hi-Mod system with two frequencies of 200–600 MHz and a resolution of 10 cm between profiles. The purpose of the survey was to understand the internal structure of the ceilings and detect eventual metallic elements. The vaults of the Historic Site of Sant Pau have a specific constructive system named “tile vaults”. They are composed of three layers of tiles, 9–10 cm thick each, supported by pillars. The tile vaults are believed to be supported by thin brick walls used as ribs. The geophysical survey confirmed this hypothesis without performing any opening of the tile. In addition, the geometry of the ribs was clearly identified for the entire vault and the metallic elements were detected (Fig. 7.6). The supporting ribs can be clearly identified in a shallow 5–9 cm time slice map. At a depth of 17–19 cm the features associated with the end of the ribs and the start of vaults could be seen. At a deeper depth of 41–45 cm the vaults and the metallic tension ties are identified. The entire main constructions elements determined and corroborated from GPR and site plans is also shown in Fig. 7.6.   148  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.4 A series of time slice images made on the south-eastern facade of the Sant Pau Historic Site.

An isosurface rendering of the wall identifies all the main structural elements  Fig. 7.5 GPR time slice images overlain on the facades of Sant Pau Historic Site and showing (cut-out) portions of south-eastern and north-eastern facades in gray scale. The north-eastern facade shows an area of weaker reflections which could be attributed to higher levels of oxidation and corrosion of the metallic tension ties at this location (After Bartrolli et al. 2011). A fuller time slice dataset from the south-eastern facade is shown in Fig. 7.4   7.3 GPR Imaging on Ancient Stone Bridges  149  Fig. 7.6 Examples of high resolution time slice images made from one of the vaulted floors at the Sant Pau Historic Site. In the shallowest image at 5–9 cm, contact points between bricks and floor tiles are imaged. Solid brick walls, iron beams and portions of the (rounded) vaulted ceilings can be seen in the deeper slices  Other vaulted ceilings were explored as the one shown in Fig. 7.7. From the survey results made of the vaulted floors at Sant Pau, it could be learned that the internal structure of the vaults do not follow a set pattern of metallic tension ties, ribs and pillars, but have individually designed geometries and separations between the elements depending on their size and shape. An example of an isosurface rendering made on one of the vaults is shown in Fig. 7.7 where the main construction elements could be distinctively separated and colorized. This render was facilitated by the fact that the construction elements were clearly separated in the depth record on the radargrams.  7.3  GPR Imaging on Ancient Stone Bridges  With contributions by Mercedes Solla, Henrique Lorenzo, Fernando Rial, and Alex Novo, University of Vigo, Spain As part of a program funded through UNESCO and ICOMOS, the potential of GPR technology for evaluating ancient masonry was initiated by the Solla et al. (2010) at the University of Vigo, Spain. A thirteenth century bridge located   150  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.7 GPR isosurface rendering of support structures found on typical vaulted floors at the Sant Pau Historic Site. Brick walls supporting the floor along with iron beams, transverse ribs and support arches could be independently identified in the time slice images and the 3D volume constructed from normalized and overlapped time slices  Fig. 7.8 The thirteenth century San Anton Bridge located in Cerdedo across the Lerez river, Galicia, Spain  in Cerdedo across the Lérez river has two extant arches one of 10.2 m span and the other 4.0 m (Fig. 7.8). The total length of the span is 31 m and it arches upward over the longest span. The surface of the bridge is paved with medieval age flagstone that is 3.5 m wide over its entire surface (Alvarado et al. 1989). San Antón was selected for investigating the applicability of GPR for assessing the structural integrity on ancient bridges. The main goal was to evaluate the fill material homogeneity, detect hidden features such as internal holes or cracks, and define its internal construction characteristics.   7.3 GPR Imaging on Ancient Stone Bridges  151  Figure 7.9 shows the processed radargram obtained with the 200 MHz unshielded antenna, and the interpretation of the main reflectors detected. A topographic survey was carried out with a total station for correction of GPR data for topography and using this topography model to apply tilt corrections to the projected scans. The 200 MHz antenna was chosen as the most suitable wavelength to research the foundations of the bridge and to analyze the material homogeneity within the structure. Structural characteristics of the arch and bridge foundations studied from the stone-air and pier-bedrock interfaces, as well as the reflections between the visible arches caused by changes in the interstitial materials, could be detected. This reflection was interpreted as the solid granite and fill material interface (since ancient bridges usually present a solid pier for structural reinforcement). Other noteworthy structural reflections observed are the ring stone reflections produced in arches due to their usual internal staircase shape; and the springer stone reflections due to their larger size in relation to the other ring stones composing the arch. While the bridge has only two visible arches, a 200 MHz radargram illustrates three large upward arching reflections. The unexpected third reflection, located between 0 and 6 m, is a reflection generated from an arch now hidden from view by later construction. There are no historical references of this third arch in the literature. This interpretation of a third-internal arch is supported by the external geometry. The bridge in itself is quite symmetric with respect to the large arch. A pointed construction feature built on the upstream side of the bridge and seen in the photo in Fig. 7.8, was used to divert water through the bridge arches and away from the middle bridge support. Assuming that this third arch reflection was generated from a hidden arch, it is important for structural stability reasons to obtain information as to whether it is empty, composed of fill, or is a solid structural material. Measuring the radar wave travel time between the reflections from the arch’s keystone and the old river bed and assuming air as the propagation medium, the reflection profile would suggest a 6 m high arch, which is unrealistic based on the present dimension of the bridge. Moreover, if the arch was empty the polarity of the reflection at the arch-air interface should be the same as the reflection from the other two arches, which is not the case (Fig. 7.9). This third arch is definitely not empty and probably filled with material of a lower velocity than stone of the arch. The fill material did not produce reflections, which suggests it is quite homogeneous in composition, but other than that little can be determined about its composition. Based on the radar patterns seen in the real GPR data it was possible to create a reasonable synthetic model of the whole bridge to facilitate with interpretation. This simplified realistic model was created from the external geometry of the bridge. The relative dielectric permeability assumed for masonry fill and granite were 7 and 9 respectively. As the radargrams were topographically corrected, the synthetic results were modified in a similar way, producing an undistorted model that is also corrected for antenna tilt. The modeling also included using a bi-static separation between the transmitter and receiver of 60 cm in the simulation calculation. The synthetic profile (Fig. 7.9) shows all reflections produced by the structural   152  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.9 GPRSIM synthetic modeling of the San Anton Bridge compared with a real 200 MHz radargram. The real radargram was corrected for the tilt of the antenna on the bridge to match the simulation that was also computed with tilt and projected into its real static position. From the synthetic models, water reflections and corner reflections (noted by TRRT waves) can be used to identify similar reflection features in space and time on the real radargram. Not all the predicted multiples seen in the synthetic radargram are identifiable in the real radargram nonetheless   7.4 GPR Measurements on an Ancient Egyptian Statue  153  elements of the bridge. The simulation model includes reflection multiples produced from the arch, as well as corner reflections caused by the perpendicular interfaces between the top of the vaults and the estimated water level. A comparison of both real and synthetic results shows how the reflected wave polarities are similar assuming a filled arch. The GPR reflection profiles acquired on this bridge surface when interpreted with the aid of accurate modeling reveal structural details and possible modifications over time. The 200 MHz results show that San Anton bridge was probably composed of three arches in ancient times, which is corroborated by the synthetic radargram model. The most probable explanation for the presence of the hidden arch may be due to a structural modification made in the past to the bridge. Problems most likely from heavy river flow seasons caused partial destruction of the bridge or caused changes in the course of the river. In order to funnel water more efficiently towards the main arch of the bridge, this older arch was filled. The hidden arch was probably filled some time ago and represents a potential architectural element that is less stable than the original stone emplacements elsewhere on the bridge. Future reinforcement would therefore need to be concentrated on this weaker portion of the bridge, which is now hidden from view.  7.4  GPR Measurements on an Ancient Egyptian Statue  Contribution by L. Sambuelli – DIATI – Politecnico di Torino. One of the most important pieces of the Museo delle Antichità Egizie of Turin is the sculpture of the god Amun with Pharoah Horemheb (Fig. 7.10a). The sculpture is extremely beautiful and well preserved and only its basement pedestal is visibly damaged, showing traces of restoration works that were likely sustained in Thebes during the year 1818 (Fig. 7.10b). The basement pedestal in particular, which was  Fig. 7.10 (a) The statue of the god Amun, sitting on the throne, with Pharaoh Horemheb standing to the side. (b) The script on the right side of the throne referring to the restoration works. (c) The restored basement front-left corner. The pedestal pieces had been reassembled and an extended network of connecting mortar is clearly visible   154  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  probably broken, underwent a heavy restoration with the use of a large amount of unknown mortar (Fig. 7.10c). By late 2008 the sculpture was planned to be one of the masterpieces of a travelling exhibition in Japan. The Fondazione Museo delle Antichità Egizie di Torino, whom manages the museum wanted to investigate the integrity of the sculpture by non destructive testing. Once established that the sculpture could be safely moved, it would allow it to be detached from the brickwork pedestal, packed and sent to Japan. The primary question was to know if some metal pins were left in the sculpture during previous restorations. Secondly it was required to estimate the extent of the visible fractures and to search for unknown ones. GPR was one method to be employed for answering these two important subsurface unknowns about the pedestal. GPR applications for planning statue restoration are less commonly used in conservation. Lab tests to estimate the rock electromagnetic parameters at GPR frequencies have been proposed by Vaccaneo et al. (2004) while a some field applications can already be found in literature i.e. Sambuelli et al. 2009, 2011; Kadioglu and Kadioglu 2010; Cosentino et al. 2011. GPR measurements presented were acquired with an IDS K2 GPR system with three different antennas: an IDS Aladdin Full Polar (2,000 MHz) and also a GSSI mod 5,100 (1,500 MHz) and GSSI 3,100 (1,000 MHz) system. The pedestal was surveyed with horizontal measurements in reflection mode with the 2,000 MHz antenna along each side of the basement, with the exception of the back side. On each of the outside faces of the pedestal three parallel horizontal profiles separated by 6 cm were collected. The upper part of the sculpture, the figure of Amun and the Pharaoh, was investigated with the 2,000 MHz antenna. The sampling frequency was 64 GHz, the time window was 32 ns and acquired with approximately 625 traces/m along the profile. An electromagnetic wave velocity in the limestone 9.2  0.5 cm/ns was found from trans-illumination tests placing 1,500 and 1,000 MHz transmitter and receiving antenna in a bistatic mode on opposite sides of the basements and on Amun’s throne.  7.4.1  Processing  A total of nine GPR profiles were included in making volume images of the base pedestal. The processing steps included (1) trace editing; (2) zero time correction, to remove the delay before the direct wave; (3) time cut, to remove the signals beyond the sides of the basement opposite to the one where the antenna slid; (4) DC drift removal of the very low frequencies (Fig. 7.11a); (5) time compression, to reduce the trace size down-sampling at 32 GHz (the resulting sampling frequency is however well beyond the Nyquist frequency that was around 4 GHz); (6) diffraction stack, to collapse the hyperbolae using 9.2 cm/ns migration velocity; and (7) spectral whitening, to shorten the reflected wavelet by equalizing the amplitude spectrum within a band from 500 to 4,000 MHz (Fig. 7.11b).   7.4 GPR Measurements on an Ancient Egyptian Statue  155  Fig. 7.11 An example radargrams collected on the upper righthand side of the basement pedestal showing the raw radargrams. (a) After DC drift correction, time 0 correction, regaining and spectral whitening, (b) migrated at 9.2 cm/ns, and (c) Hilbert transformed radargrams Fig. 7.12 3D isosurface rendering assembled from the nine radargrams obtained from the right, front and left side of the base pedestal of the statue of the god Aman and Pharoah Horemheb. The envelope of the Hilbert transform, related to the instantaneous amplitude of reflection is plotted. The isosurface shown in 20 % of the peak amplitude response  With the 1,500 MHz antenna records we also evaluated the trace envelope, or instantaneous amplitude, using the Hilbert’s transform. The nine radargrams from the three investigated sides of the basement were then properly located in the space within the basement volume. Three level depth slices were generated at 6.25, 12.5 and 18.75 cm within the pedestal. These slices were independently normalized, which helps remove the influence of the differential gaining to radar pulses, and then interpolated to yield a 3d volume of the squared Hilbert transform or reflected energy. A 3d isosurface rendering of the instantaneous amplitude of reflections within the basement was then generated (Fig. 7.12). The radargrams on the sculpture bodies were processed in a similar way and in the vertical profiles a good semiquantitative correspondence could be found between the main reflections and the front surface of the statue (Fig. 7.13).   156  7 GPR Imaging on Historical Buildings and Structures  Fig. 7.13 Superposition of a vertical GPR profile collected on the side the statue where Pharoah Horemheb is standing. The correspondence of the main reflections with the surface of the statue is very good. It is worthy to note how the different positions of the pharaoh’s legs is evidenced in the radargram  7.4.2  Results  The GPR analysis excluded the presence of metallic objects inside the sculpture. Moreover the measurements on the basements confirmed the persistence of several fractures inside the basement itself, in particular the ones located in the right corner in front of the pharaoh. GPR imaging evidenced possible fractures not detectable by a visual inspection below the Amun’s throne. On the other hand, some fractures, clearly observable from outside, were not recognized in the radargrams. A possible explanation is that in some points and in some fractures, there is a lower reflection coefficient between the mortar and limestone. The GPR analysis of the upper part of the statue did not show any significant reflections that might be indicative of fracturing. In fact, in each radargram, the opposite surface of the statue was clearly visible. It is not absolutely conclusive but metal reinforcements do not appear to have been used in the restoration of the base.

One of the first applications of GPR in cemeteries for discovering unmarked graves were initiated nearly four decades ago by Bevan and Kenyon 1975. The primary motivation for GPR surveys has often been to assist in the mitigation of sites by helping to detect the presence of unmarked burials. Cemeteries have come under constant pressure from development projects and knowing the areal extent of cemeteries in prime land areas has been crucial. Many cemeteries which are not under developmental pressures may have been abandoned or lacked funds to maintain the sites. Often these cemeteries are missing headstones or site markers after being vandalized or from just plain neglect over time. There are new and growing cemetery management efforts to find unmarked burials so that vacant spaces in these cemeteries can be sold as new burial plots. GPR technology is ideally suited to assist in the rediscovery of cemetery sites. GPR is often capable of imaging backfilled burial pits as well as detecting reflections from the burials at depth when the remains are fully or partially intact. It is useful to examine several kinds of historic grave structures that may exist so that the interpreter can get familiar with the resulting radargram patterns that might be recorded. To aid in understanding recorded radargram patterns across burials, several simulations are developed to show some of the key reflection patterns that can be recorded. Intact burials, burial pits with no intact remains, and heterogeneous backfilled pits with and without remains are discussed. These select simulation models by no means represent the multitude of burial structures and conditions that can exist, however, they do represent the common situations and can be used by the interpreter to extrapolate the real recorded data to reasonable model structures of their sites. In addition, understanding the 2d profiles over historic burials is  D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_8, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  159   160  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  Fig. 8.1 A simulation made from an intact burial existing in a strongly pronounced burial pit. Reflections from the top of the intact burial are clearly seen. Reflections from the top of the burial pit cause diffractions off the edges and these can be recorded in the upper regions of the radargram. For purposes of understanding the “randomness” of recorded radar reflections and the sensitivity of the recorded patterns for small changes in the burial structures, the burial pit and the coffin are not drawn perfectly symmetric  essential to comprehending how surveys from closely spaced radar profiles are translated into the features observed in 3d imaging. A generalized simulation to visualize the typical reflections that may get recorded from an intact coffin existing in a burial pit is shown in Fig. 8.1. In this example, the backfilled soils above the burial are assumed to be continuous from the surface downward. The edges of the burial pit profiles are purposely drawn with rough rounded edges (and are not drawn symmetrical). Radar wave are reflected or diffract from the edges creating reflection legs emanating from very shallow depths that trend to the central portions of the burial pit with depth. The burial pit in this model is signified by a relatively weak reflection in the near surface region which will become a key point in detection of unmarked graves. In upper depth regions diffraction tales from the edges of the pit or even multiple reflections inside the pit can be recorded above the pit. These unique reflections may be an indicator that a burial was intersected on a radar profile. The intact burial can typically show a strong hyperbolic like reflection pattern. The reflections off the coffin can also be complicated by multiple reflections.   8.1 Introduction via GPR Simulation  161  Fig. 8.2 Example simulation of a burial pit filled with heterogeneous material during backfilling. The coffin is assumed to be completely decayed and not present. The heterogeneous backfill material, caused by dislocation of top soil layers and reburying, helps to illuminate the central pit area via radar wave scattering back to the GPR receiving antenna  At some historic cemeteries, pit depressions are the only remnant structures detected that are indicative that a burial once existed at the site. Often historic burials do not have many intact coffin and these sites usually have experienced significant weathering and decay. Some burials will have no bones or casket material left. These burials however, were constructed in a way that could lend itself to future discovery. During the operation of backfilling with heterogeneous material the remnant burial pit can make these lost graves detectable. For instance, one might imagine that a nicely layered topsoil that has several unique soil layers below this level where the burial pit was dug, will get mixed up during backfilling into the burial pit. This in turn will present a fill material that has scatters at different levels above the burial pit. These scatters are composed of the individual elements from the different soil layer randomly pushed back into the pit. An example of a burial that has this kind of configuration and does not have an intact burial is shown in Fig. 8.2. The high density of scatters within the burial pit represents an abundance of radar reflecting targets that will illuminate the pit as an overall strong reflection area. The features within the pit however will not have a regular radar pattern and it will just show a collection of stronger isolated/random reflections. (Note, that numerous   162  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  Fig. 8.3 Example simulation of an intact burial at depth, overlain by heterogeneous scattering soil materials located within the backfilled pit. Shallow scatters in the backfill material can shield or degenerate the radar presence of an intact burial  kinds of waves are included to insure that the measurable scattered energy is recorded back at the antenna). This burial though may also have tale tell edge reflections recorded near the upper level portions of the radargram. There are often intact burials at depth that can become “hidden” at depth for a variety of reasons. If the burial pit is filled with heterogeneous material in the fill region above the burial, then only a portion of the energy from the transmitting antenna may reach an intact coffin and get reflected back to the receiving. An example is shown for the same structure seen in Fig. 8.2 with the addition of an intact stone coffin placed at the bottom of the burial pit is presented in Fig. 8.3 for comparison. The reflections coming back from the top surface of the coffin are sporadically recorded and yield a very bumpy/noisy top surface reflection. A casual interpretation of the vertical profile across the burial one might mistakenly assume that the coffin was not intact or collapsed or not even present. However, the fill material might mask the coffin at depth. Often sites with highly conductive soils, even in the presence homogenous fill materials above the coffin, may also hide intact burials because of the attenuation of the GPR signal. Another common model of a burial is just the presence of a backfilled pit that is completely homogenous in electrical composition and also having no intact coffin (Fig. 8.4). The identifying reflections for these kinds of historic burials if they are   8.2 Old Seminole Cemetery, Florida  163  Fig. 8.4 Simulation of a burial where the backfilled material above the pit is homogenous. Overall relatively weak reflections are recorded above the burial where no remains are presence. Edge reflections can also be observed in these (generalized model) burials  presence are overall lower reflections recorded at the upper top portion of the pit. Diffraction from the pit edges can also be an important indicator that a burial was traversed. The pit fill material in this simulation was modeled with higher conductivity (.02 mho/m). The pit floor is recorded on the travel time plot but is shown as a faintly recorded reflection. Often the floors of pits are not seen because of attenuation of the radar waves.  8.2  Old Seminole Cemetery, Florida  With contributions by Kent Schneider, US Forest Service and the Seminole Tribe of Florida An example where the burial pit shows very weak reflections on the top and much stronger reflections within the pit as burial remains or scattering material within the pit are encountered, is shown in a radar profile recorded at the Old Seminole Cemetery in Ft Lauderdale, Florida. In Fig. 8.5 one shallow time slice is displayed with a corresponding radargram and in a 3 s fence arrangement so that the reflections can be better correlated. The complete time slice dataset is provided in Fig. 8.6. The shallow time slice in Fig. 8.5 and the radargram along the line   164  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  Fig. 8.5 In this image a radargram taken across 6–7 distinct burials in a row is recorded. The low reflections anomalies at the top of the burial pits are easily identified on the shallow time slice near 17 cm. No intact burials are observed below the pits located in the region from 110 to 180 ft. Two anomalies associated with clear intact burials but without burial pit reflections or disturbances above the burials are identified at 110 and 210 ft (also shown in Fig. 8.6)  y ¼ 224 ft shows a series of relatively weak reflections over the tops of the rectangular burial pits which are closely spaced together. The burial pit edge reflections which emanate from the top can also be seen to have diffraction legs in some locations crisscrossing at the suspected centers of the pits. This region is   Fig. 8.6 Time slices made at the Old Seminole Cemetery in Florida showing weak reflections on the top surface of the burial pits, 0–5 and 8–13 cm time slices. Stronger reflections can be found deeper in the pits as a result of reflections from backfilled scatters in the burial pit (24–29 cm). A few isolated strong anomalies for instance on line x ¼ 226 (y ¼ 112 and 209 ft) are highly indicative of unmarked – intact burials at the site  8.2 Old Seminole Cemetery, Florida 165   166  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  distinguished by lack of any continuous strong reflections at depth inside the burial pits suggesting that no intact coffin remains are present. The regular rows and placement of burials with weak reflection is clearly seen in the complete time slices series at 0–5 and 8–13 cm levels in Fig. 8.6. Just slightly deeper in depth, stronger reflections are encountered in the same locations within the pits. On the 24–29 cm levels the pits are illuminated as stronger reflections suggesting that the backfilled scatters in the pit may be contributing to this detection. These depths are probably too shallow for burial remains to have been encountered. However, reflections at this level could be from partially intact burial remains working its way upward should the weathering at the site have removed some top soils. The suggestion that many of the strong reflections are a result of backfill scatters seems valid since the area with a high density of parallel burial pit reflections detected, do not have strong reflections indicative of intact coffins at depth. However, other areas do indicate strong reflections at depth indicative of intact coffins are present. The Old Seminole Cemetery has several locations where intact burials are found in areas where no pit reflection are indicated. The isolated anomalies at ranges ¼ 209 and 112 ft seen on the same radargram profile in Fig. 8.5 are examples where intact burials are detected at depth – but also where no radar reflections illuminating the burial pit above the intact burials are detected! The reflections near the top surface above these graves are relatively clean. The coffins in these location are also probably of good construction or more recently entombed at the site. The shape of the contours of the coffin will be the most important factor describing the ultimate radar pattern that is collected. (Early work by Goodman (1994) involved attempts to determine the shape of stone coffins in Japan that were intact from Kofun period burials. Although in theory, with perfect knowledge of the subsurface structure, the shape of coffins might be estimated, in practice, the variability of the overlying materials makes forward modeling less likely to succeed in giving accurate measurements of the outside profile of the coffin). In highly developed historic cemeteries, the fact that the burials are closely spaced helps to improve the detectability. When rows of rectangular anomalies are recorded, the confidence in the interpretation of discovering unmarked burials is much higher. When historic cemeteries have just a few isolated burials, it often becomes more difficult to conclusively say that a single isolated burial pit reflection that might get recorded is in fact a burial pit and not just a local soil feature unrelated to a burial. The next example examines a family owned historic cemetery which was not commercially developed and thus burial positioning was less regular.  8.3  Pascual Marquez Cemetery: Santa Monica Canyon, California  With contributions by Brian Damiata, Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, UCLA Tish Nettleship and Ernest Marquez, La Senora Institute Ysidro Reyes and Francisco Marquez families jointly received a Mexican Land Grant in 1839. The 6,656 acre rancho grant extended from today’s 26th Street in   8.3 Pascual Marquez Cemetery: Santa Monica Canyon, California  167  Santa Monica to the Ocean and from Montana Blvd to a mile past Topanga Canyon. The family businesses included ranching during its first 70 years, and later a popular bathhouse near the entrance to the Santa Monica Canyon and the beach at the turn of the century (Fig. 8.7). Although a church and a cemetery were located in downtown Los Angeles, the trek from Santa Monica was a difficult journey in the 1800s and wagon trail roads were impassable at times. For this reason the Marquez and Reyes families made a cemetery on their own property – the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. Family oral history tells that Pascual Marquez, the son of Francisco, was buried in the ruins of his father’s adobe house. Pascual passed away in 1916 and was the last to be buried at the Marquez and Reyes Family Cemetery. He was buried in a grave that was believed to be the location of the original rancho on the site (bottom right – Fig. 8.7). The orientation and location of his grave was said to be reconstructed in the same position of his bedroom in the first adobe house that Francisco built. The Pascual Marquez Family Cemetery was lucky to survive the onslaught of overdevelopment in the Santa Monica Canyon. To help the family rediscover lost graves at the site, a GPR survey was initiated and overseen by the La Senora Institute which is non-profit organization dedicated to preserving cultural heritage in the Santa Monica Canyon. Detailing the extent of burials could also assist in the official designation of the site as a cultural landmark, given that it was the first cemetery in Santa Monica. The present condition of the site indicated that only two stone grave markers remained. All the original wood crosses had been removed or lost by the mid 1920s according to Ernest Marquez, the great grandson of Francisco Marquez. Surviving family members were able to estimate the location of one burial some years ago, and reconstructed the main Pascual Marquez burial on the site. All the other burials, believed to be nearly 35 total, were never remarked nor these locations precisely known. The GPR survey was conducted with profiles collected in both X and Y directions at 25 cm spacing. A shallow time slice map shows several anomalies that could correspond with wooden crosses seen from an old photograph made in the early 1900s (Fig. 8.8). Interpretations were made to assign the crosses to suspected unmarked grave reflections. The largest cross seen in the photo is believed to be the original grave marking for Pascual Marquez which was later rebuilt in granite (Fig. 8.7). One of the closest burials to this was identified by another family member as where he had been told that his great grandmother Felipa Marquez had been buried. This surviving family member, Joseph Peyton along with other relative accounts provided better confidence in the interpretation of GPR imaging since this was one location where an unmarked burial was estimated to be. The cemetery over the years had infants laid to rest at the site. Recollections by the older family members told of these burials being located in the northeast side of the cemetery as one entered the gate. A very shallow time slice image right on the surface shows four or five small squarish anomalies that are closely spaced in this region (Fig. 8.9). The suggested burial pits right from the top surface show strong reflections and do not have initially weak reflections at the tops of the pits. This may   168  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  Fig. 8.7 Photographs of the Marquez Bath House, the entrance to the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early twentieth century photo of the Cemetery after partial reconstruction, the adobe house where Pascual Marquez was born, and where the his family cemetery was later built (Photographs courtesy of The Ernesto Marquez Photo Collections)  infer that these graves have either scattering backfill material right at the surface or that perhaps the burials were backfilled or protected with some different materials to make them stand out on shallow radar images.

The closely spaced pits are nearly square anomalies about 1–1.25 m on a side. These smaller than normal reflections would be indicative of infant burials which are shorter than typical adult grave dimensions. One of the heart wrenching tragedies in the Marquez family was the loss of 13 family members after a New Years Eve celebration in 1909 in which all the relatives consumed canned peaches that were contaminated with botulism. Ten of the family members were buried in a mass grave within the Pascual Marquez Family Cemetery. The mass grave was not documented in any old photos, nor did any surviving family member have any idea about where the mass grave may be located in the cemetery. Shallow GPR images show a rectilinear feature which is consistent with a long trench which may have be used to entomb the lost members (Fig. 8.10). The trench, located in the northeast corner of the cemetery, may extend past the present day cemetery walls which were constructed on the site in the 1920s without full knowledge of the extent and dimensions of the burial site. The suspected mass grave as well as other burials extending beyond the walls of the current cemetery still remains a strong possibility. The Pascual Marquez Family Cemetery was also surveyed with specially trained cadaver dogs that can scent out traces of lost burials. There was some correlation on the northwest corner of the site where the suspected large mass burial trench is estimated by GPR, however in other areas there was not a perfect agreement between anomalies and dog hits. The possibility of unmarked burials outside the   8.4 Jena Choctaw: WhiteRock Cemetery, Louisiana  171  Fig. 8.11 Overlay of the top time slice map of the Pascual Marquez Cemetery in Google Earth. Remarkably, the cemetery was able to survive today under pressure from continued development in the Santa Monica Canyon  cemetery remains a strong possibility. The adobe wall of cemetery was erected in 1926 without any intact burial monuments existing at the time to help guide the complete enclosure of the site. The walls were constructed at the time as a best estimate on the cemetery boundaries but also cosmetically bounded so that surrounding land divisions for home constructions could be auctioned off. Some indication from an overlay of a shallow time slice map on top of a Google Earth image (Fig. 8.11) indicate that continuation of anomalies close to the adobe wall may extend into adjacent residences.  8.4  Jena Choctaw: WhiteRock Cemetery, Louisiana  With contributions from Velicia Bergstrom, US Forest Service, Louisiana At Jena Choctaw – WhiteRock Cemetery in Pineville Louisiana, many marked and unmarked graves are known to exist at the site. Reflections from graves with intact coffin typically show strong reflections. Some of the caskets are known to actually be made of metal. Because of the high water table in these parts of Louisiana, heavy caskets are often used to insure that they do not start to float in the ground and work their way upwards to eventually get exposed on the surface. The site was surveyed in 2004 with GPR using GPS navigation as well as a regular XY gridded dataset. The GPS survey was completed with a single radargram track recording spaced approximately 50 cm across the site (Fig. 8.12). This is one of the first ever recordings of a burial site using GPS that was also successful in mapping   172  8 North America: GPR Surveying at Historic Cemeteries  Fig. 8.12 Example of a radargram profile across an intact coffin recorded at the White Rock Cemetery in Pineville, Louisiana  marked and unmarked burials. Although the site was in a forest, the cemetery itself did not have any trees and was conducive to receiving the GPS satellites. An example of a portion of a radargram on top of a burial at the WhiteRock Cemetery is shown in Fig. 8.12. A strong coffin reflection is recorded in one location as well as some faint edge reflections on the top portion above the burial can be seen (Fig. 8.11). There appear to be some weak reflections from the backfill scatterers recorded above the suspected coffin. In this example, the scatterers do not necessarily degrade the coffin reflection as discussed earlier and as shown in the simulation in Fig. 8.3. In the radargram shown, there is also a weaker reflection that could be a burial that is less preserved. The edge reflections that are above the suspected faint burial in Fig. 8.12 are not imaged as symmetrical reflections legs on both sides of the burial pit. Reflections/diffractions from the burial pit edges can have random structural features that may or may not reflect energy back to the antenna. The interpretation of the radargrams can also be inconclusive themselves, particularly when profiling over burials when their orientation in the ground is not known prior to the survey. Profiles over burials that are not parallel or perpendicular to the grave can lead to some misinterpretation when just using the 2d dataset. The variability in the time slice information is less influenced by the profile direction as long as sufficient line density is achieved in the survey. When sites with intact burials and with relatively weak reflections above the burials from the backfill material exists, isosurface rendering of the data can sometimes present some very useful and understandable images. Shown in Fig. 8.13 is an example of isosurface rendering of the 50 % strongest reflecting surface recorded in the 3D volume. The isosurface is set to map the reflection energy determined from windowed averages of the pulse over about 1 ½ wavelengths that were interpolated from overlapped slices. In this image, the interpretation of just the strongest reflectors rendered in the isosurface appears to be actually more convincing than the time slice dataset which is also given. Isosurfaces however will not show reflections below the desired thresholding levels and are really maps of the relatively stronger reflections features that stand out above the background.   8.4 Jena Choctaw: WhiteRock Cemetery, Louisiana  173  Fig. 8.13 Example time slices along with an isosurface render of the 50 % strongest reflector recorded at the WhiteRock – Jena Choctaw – Cemetery.

Even though the first introductions of multi-channel GPR systems and designs date back more than two decades (e.g. Warhus et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 1991), the complete acceptance of multi-channel recording was limited by the quality of the data and complex data processing (Francese et al. 2009). Differences in the frequency responses and directional responses of similarly manufactured antenna elements as well as cross talking between elements proved to be problematic. Individually, the channels would often look very good but collectively these early systems were not balanced enough between the different elements to work effectively as a multichannel array. However, in recent years, most of the multi-channel manufacturers have provided GPR systems where the antenna responses of the individual elements are very similar (Linford et al. 2010; Trinks et al. 2010; Simi et al. 2010). With the cross-line spacing between adjacent antenna approaching a 1/4 wavelength of the transmitted microwaves into the ground, multi-channel systems have the advantage of complete coverage of a site (Grasmueck et al. 2004; Novo et al. 2008) allowing for full resolution imaging. Multi-channel systems can best be defined as full resolution GPR systems when crossline separation of the antenna approach the 1/4 wavelength of the transmit pulses in the ground (Annan 2009). With most multi-channel systems today interpolation to generate 3D volume of continuous GPR pulses collected on a site is not required. Occasionally, interpolation can be use to fill in the gaps between adjacent tracks if so desired (Goodman et al. 2011). Multi-channel systems do require additional radargram signal processes in order to balance the channels and to condition the data prior to imaging. RSP can be  With contributions from Alex Novo, University of Vigo (Vigo, Spain) and Gianfranco Morelli, GeoAstier, (Livorno, Italy). D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3_9, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  175   176  9 Multi-channel GPR  applied to the antenna channel radargrams to compensate for small differences in the frequency responses and can make signal balancing between the different elements reasonably close to be used in image construction. The typical RSP implemented for the individual channels are: • • • • • • •  Removal of DC drift 0 ns editing Gaining Spectral whitening and/or bandpass filtering Background removal Migration Hilbert transform  In DC drift removal a simple time domain pulse moving average is used. The subtracted windowed moving average along the pulse is effectively done on ungained raw radargrams, and brings floating DC pulses back to the 0 line. This initial process insures that proper gaining of the pulses can be done before spectral whitening or bandpass filtering. The moving average window approaching about 1/10 the scan length is commonly used. Editing of the radargram signal for the 0 ns employs a user defined threshold on the initial pulse or a search for the peak of the first pulse. The threshold or peak sample detected is then backed up a set number of samples to indicate the rise of the initial pulse. As the 0 ns editing is usually done in automatic mode, it is key to choose a proper trigger threshold to insure that all the channels begin at the same ground level. Some equipment have digital noises before the ground wave recording and these can be avoided as false 0 ns locations on the pulse using typically higher trigger thresholds. A key RSP is to apply spectral whitening when the frequency responses of the antenna elements are not so close. Spectral whitening with a sharp cutoff on the high and low frequencies is used. This signal process is most important when the antenna channels are less than balanced in the frequency domain and this filter can help to bring the channels closer to matching pulse responses. For spectral whitening, the complex amplitudes of all the frequencies between the low and high bandpass frequency cutoffs are all set to unity before inverse FFTs are made without spectral tapering. Spectral whitening can bring the responses of the channels much closer together. However, this filter can also create some graininess in the final radargrams which can be controlled with an optional boxcar filter. When the antenna channels in any given array system have much closer balancing between the channel frequency responses, spectral whitening can be replaced with simple bandpass filtering. An example of several channels from an array system comparing the original recorded raw data along with the RSP radargrams is shown in Fig. 9.1. Multi-channel imaging of several sites at the Institute for Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (ITABC) of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR), in Rome was made at a workshop (GPR Methods for Archaeology and Historical Buildings) in December of 2010 with an IDS STREAM X multi-channel system.   9.1 Test Site Surveying  177  Fig. 9.1 ITABC-CNR test site (Italy). Comparison of five channels of raw radargrams from the IDS Stream X multi-channel system with the processed channels with DC drift removal, 0 ns editing, gaining, spectral whitening, background removal, and boxcar smoothing (Data courtesy of Gianfranco Morelli, GeoStudi Astier, Livorno, Italy)  ITABC of CNR in Rome is the national laboratories dedicated to the knowledge, safeguard and preservation of cultural heritage. One survey was made over a calibration area where known objects were placed in a test area. Shown in Fig. 9.2 is an image made across the test site which has several rectangular pits full of sandstone. One of the test pits (6 4 1.5 m) has a metal cylinder, 50 cm in diameter placed at a depth of 1.5 m.   178  9 Multi-channel GPR  Fig. 9.2 Multi-channel imaging at a test area at ITABC at CNR in Rome using the IDS Stream X, 15 channel system. A metal sphere buried at the test site is imaged very accurately across the GPR array  On one of the swaths the complete round image from the metal sphere is nearly perfectly imaged as a round target on the time slice. The GPR configuration used a 15 channel setup where the antenna separation was 12 cm. This system has additional flexibility to use two linear arrays that are offset to provide a 4 or 6 cm element separation as well. Because the density of lines provided by the multichannel recording is high, the necessity to interpolate between the channels is less important. Initial densities within the 3d volume can be configured to roughly match the in-line or cross-line spacing, or to propagate the volume grid cell sizes to densities higher than recorded pulse spacing. In the case when higher densities are desired, gap filling between empty binary cells can be applied using a simple nearest neighbor averaging or an inverse distance weighting if interpolation beyond nearest cells is needed. Inter-channel gap filling in which searches parallel to the cross-line direction can also be applied optionally. A second area was also investigated at ITABC and is a site with possible Sabine tombs buried on the top of a sloping hillside. Shown in Fig. 9.3 is a 3d fence plot of the site. Although tombs were not unequivocally discovered at this particular site, the image clearly shows dipping stratigraphic layers. The advantages of high density lines afforded by multi-channel imaging, are that full resolution volumes can be generated and effectively show radargrams cuts in any direction to provide stratigraphic information. The antenna separation is sufficient to map and show stratigraphic 2d sections in any direction across the site which can help to identify the cultural layers. The 3d-Radar GeoScope system of Norway is a 31 channel system with individual antennas separated by 7.5 cm. The system is a frequency modulated – continuous wave multi-channel system. The data are bandpassed to present typical pulse radargrams which have an optimum center frequency near 400 MHz. An earlier configuration of the equipment had 200 and 600 MHz bandpassed radargrams that   9.1 Test Site Surveying  179  Fig. 9.3 Multi-channel imaging at a site with possible Sabine tombs on a hillside near the ITABC, CNR laboratory.

The large oval like structure was originally visible as a crop mark, and is believed to be a burial structure or a destroyed building that may also be associated with a burial (Data courtesy of Kevin Barton, Landscape and Geophysical Services, Ireland, and 3dRadar of Norway)  were collected in alternate locations across the array. To process this multi-channel dataset every other profile was used to generate a 3d volume. This made the antenna separation 15 cm with 16 channels. Shown in Fig. 9.4 is an image made from a   180  9 Multi-channel GPR  Chieftain Hall archaeological grave site in Norway. A large oval like structures was imaged. This is believed to possibly be the grave site for a servant of King Olav (Barton et al. 2009). The quality of the multi-channel imaging can be seen with good detail. A similar survey was made with a single channel Noggin GPR system, supporting a 250 MHz antenna and the survey data collected with a line spacing of 25 cm (Barton et al. 2009). The single channel also show similarly very good images since the density of lines was better than typical coarser surveys that are commonly made at 50 cm or 1 m. The multi-channel data however, show better detail because of the even denser line spacing.  9.2  Castrocielo Site (Frosinone, Italy)  A plaza in front of an old restored church, in the Municipality of Castrocielo (Frosinone) located in the Lazio region of Italy was surveyed with a IDS Stream multi-channel system (Fig. 9.5), during a Summer School “Geophysics and Aerial Photography for Archaeology”, June 2011, (http://grs-lab.itabc.cnr.it). The site is within a 20 min drive to Monte Cassino (Frosinone, Italy) which was the southernmost fortification of the German defenses in World War II in Italy. The church has undergone recent renovations and was completely restored. The multi-channel system supported 12 channels separated by 8 cm and operating at a central frequency of 600 MHz. Navigation for the array was done using the survey wheel. The raw radargrams were processed for time 0 ns, regaining, spectral whitening and background filtering. Subsurface images of the site indicate several reflection horizons could be detected beneath the church plaza. Shown in top diagram of Fig. 9.6 is a time slice viewed at 14 cm below the plaza surface some indications of tiling can be seen. At the deeper time slice level of 28 cm, various rectangular  Fig. 9.5 Municipality of Castrocielo (Forsinone, Italy).

These older structures parallel an above ground ancient wall that is built at an angle on the northern border of the church plaza. This map indicates that the older plaza structures were constructed in relationship to the existing walls at the time, and that the deeper structural trends are not parallel to the present day church of Castrocielo.  9.3  Empuries Archaeological Site (Spain)  The town of Empuries, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain (Catalonia) was founded by Greek colonists in the sixth century BC. The town was later occupied by the Romans in the first century BC and then completely abandoned by the Early Middle Ages.

The 15 channel array is 1.68 m in length supporting 15 dipoles mounted in a parallel broadside configuration. The center frequency is 200 MHz  so far only uncovered 20 % of the site. To quickly detail the unexcavated areas as well as to achieve high density of radar coverage, a Stream X multi-channel system was employed. This system is configured with a 1.68 m wide massive array containing 15 dipoles mounted in a parallel broadside configuration with a 12 cm antenna separation and a center frequency of 200 MHz (Fig. 9.7). The acquisition was efficiently carried out by collecting the profiles in both directions, forward and backwards and synced with RTK GPS. The 1 ha survey area was covered with 53 swaths in less than 2 h. The final processed depth slices provide excellent insights into the structures and remains of the archaeology at this site. The walls and other reflection anomalies appear very clear and sharp on the images (Fig. 9.8). The subsurface reflection maps show a grid of streets that do not match exactly with the hypothetical urban organization, but show new elements such as the oblique direction of some streets located in some southern portions of the site. The excavations in other sectors of the Roman city showed unpaved streets, which is consistent with the diffuse, high amplitude anomalies detected for the streets A, B and F, and are regions where elevated levels of gravel are present. The southern portion of street F shows a changing geometry with depth that is interpreted as a ramp (R), built to level the 2 m difference between the SW entrance with the inner city elevations. The anomalies associated with street reflections appear between 0.65 and 0.9 m below the surface, and in some cases, 30 cm higher than the floors of adjacent houses. These remote sensing finding are consistent with results discovered from excavations in northern locations in the Empuries.   9.3 Empuries Archaeological Site (Spain)  183  Fig. 9.8 A 1.15 depth slice at Empuries, Spain shows well defined subsurface Roman structures retained beneath the agricultural field. The data were collected with an IDS Stream X multichannel GPR system supporting 15 channels at 12 cm separation. The GPR Survey was made in conjunction Roger Sala Bartroli, Ekhine Garcia Garcia, and Robert Tamba, SOT Prospeccio (www.sotprospection.com)  A complex architectural subdivision was found inside of the covered insulae, where some elements of Roman domestic architecture (see ATR anomaly interpreted as a floor of an atrium in Figure 9.2) can be recognized. Walls and linear features show well-defined geometries such as near 21 and 13. The complete time slice sequence does show differences among the reflection amplitudes of some of these walls that could be explained by differences in their composition. Flat reflectors such as floors or pavements of atriums (ATR) were also clearly imaged. Inside some of the detected rooms, the floors show higher amplitudes that could be explained by the presence of an opus signum pavement for example. These kinds of Roman floors contain smaller pieces of broken up tile and put together with mortar. The small inclusions of the opus signum pavement preferentially scatter back more radar waves and appear as relatively stronger reflections in the time slice images.   184  9 Multi-channel GPR  Fig. 9.9 Interpretation of Roman remains found from multi-channel GPR surveys at Empuries, Girona, Spain (After Novo et al. 2011)  Regarding the depth and different detected levels, the high resolution of the data allowed obtaining good images from superimposed features. In insula 13, changes in the wall divisions and a possible cistern (C) under the floor level that appear can be clearly seen even below a depth of 2 m (Fig. 9.9).

Certain stratigraphy or geologic structures if found to exist are known to increase the likelihood of subsurface cultural materials. If these areas can be mapped in advance of development projects, then guidance can be given to engineers on which areas to avoid for construction project. One example of a GPR survey with an objective to delineate geologic features and not to specifically identify any subsurface archaeology was conducted at Foster Island, Washington State (Fig. 10.1). The survey results were to be an important part of planning the reconstruction HOV 520 which is a floating road way and bridge that transects Lake Washington and Lake Union and also bisects Foster Island. Foster Island was originally a much smaller island, however, when the Montlake Cut was made in 1916 to connect Lake Washington and Lake Union for boat traffic, the water level fell in Lake Washington by 10 ft, exposing more of the island. Early maps of the site originally show the island as two small islands located very close together before the Montlake Cut was made. Afterwards, the two islands appeared as a single island connected as the lower lying lakebed was exposed. The purpose in performing a GPR survey at the site was to see if soils that were originally deposited below the waterline in the lake, may be substantially different than soils that were on the original part of the island that was always above water. Indian sites and grave sites are known to exist in several locations on the island. The engineers are confident that if original island materials that were above ground could be identified or likewise if areas of exposed lakebed sediments could be mapped, then the location of the new bridge and roadway to be built could be made to only transect across regions where the exposed lakebed sediments exist. The exposed lakebed sediments would most likely have no Native American sites or grave sites and the roadway could be built with confidence in these locations that no subsurface archaeology would be excavated during construction.

In this simple three layer model, soil, lakebed sediments and glacial till are modeled. The GPR synthetic radargram suggests that areas where lakebed sediments are thickest would be on areas furthest away from the original island boundary. Sloping stratigraphy towards the center of the original island might also indicate that a layered structure is present with lakebed sediments dominating on the outskirts of the original island. The most general interpretation however, is that overall   10.1  Foster Island, Washington State  189  Fig. 10.2 A GPR simulation was run on a possible candidate model of Foster Island to predict the reflection profile from a proposed stratigraphic model of the site. In this example simulation, the lakebed sediments are distinguished from deeper lying glacial till. The reflective energy on the top of the island is overall weaker than the areas which were originally underwater and which represent the exposed lakebed sediments  reflection energies in the outlaying exposed lake bed sediments would probably be higher as stratigraphic variations could reflect more energy back to the antenna. The soil structure on the top of the original island is assumed to be more homogenous and thereby would not have as many subsurface scatters to reflect energy back – yielding overall weaker reflection returns in these locations. Many west-east radargrams were collected at the site, however, several north–south transects were also recorded. These transects were chosen since they could travel the longest in the grassy area on the northern island without running into obstacles. The north–south profiles were also purposely chosen to transect the higher topographic areas within the survey field, and these most likely have some components of the original island boundary along the line. Shown in Fig. 10.3 are several parallel transects with simple standard topography corrections and signal processing applied, including the Hilbert transform. Examination of the data shows various strong reflectors along the profiles. The general appearance of the radargrams does not indicate strongly stratified soils that might indicate clear reflections from a boundary between lakebed sediments or from original island soils. The areas with overall strong reflections might be assigned to lakebed sediments and the overall weak reflecting areas might represent the original island sediments. The original island sediments, if they are composed of much more homogenous soils, would reflect less of the radar energy since these soils are most likely less contrasted. Also, if the proposed structure of the island, as depicted   190  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.3 Examples of topographically adjusted radargrams made across locations on Foster Island. Stronger reflections can be seen on the flanks of the radargrams than on the middle portion – top part of the island, but, these observations are not strikingly obvious when viewing just the 2d dataset  in the simulation is correct, then the “homogenous” soils of the original island would not reflect back radar waves since there is no significant layering. Radar waves only reflect off areas with electrical contrast in the ground – completely homogenous materials have no boundaries to reflect GPR waves – and the radar   10.1  Foster Island, Washington State  191  Fig. 10.4 An overlay analysis image from 0 to 59 cm containing all the relative-strongest-reflectors mapped at Foster Island. The weaker reflections (in green) areas are most likely delineating portions of the original island sediments that were always above ground. The stronger reflections (red) represent reflections from former lakebed sediments that were below the waterline before the Montlake Cut was constructed. (Publication courtesy of the Washington State Dept of Transportation)  waves travel down into the ground, dissipate, and do not get reflected. Nonetheless, the “perfect” stratigraphic information depicted in the model simulation, could never be conclusively seen on any single radargram collected in the GPR survey data at Foster Island. However, time slice imaging and overlay analysis are able to show the power of these kinds of imaging methods over simple 2D profile radargram displays. With overlay analysis changes between the loosely contrasted soils that were originally above and below the waterline could be effectively discovered. Shown in Fig. 10.4 is an overlay time slice from 27 to 91 cm of the Foster Island 270 MHz GPR survey placed in Google Earth. The overall weak reflections show areas which are most likely regions on the original exposed island. This general mapped boundary between the lakebed and original island soils in the overlay image are also similar to the topographic contours, as one would expect. An alternative image using an isosurface rendering with topography applied to the site (Fig. 10.5) was generated using the 60 % strongest reflecting contour in the volume. This imagery shows areas where only illuminated locations are most likely lakebed sediments that were not originally above ground before the lake level was lowered. These relatively stronger reflection regions shown, could be deemed as safe areas where reconstruction of the floating bridge highway could traverse with the least likely potential to disturb subsurface archaeological remains.   192  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.5 An isosurface rendering of Foster Island for the 60 % strongest reflector mapped in the 3D datasets shows areas illuminated that most likely represent former lakebed sediments that were below the waterline  10.2  Avraga Site: Eastern Mongolia  With contributions by Yasuyuki Murakami, Ehime University and Niriyuki Shiraishi, Niigata University, Japan. Genghis Khan was a military chief who was able to unify many tribes and partake in founding the Mongol Empire by conquering large parts of Asia, including northern China, western Xia, Central Asia, Persia and Mongolia. He was the grandfather of Kublai Khan, the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty in China. Our knowledge of the life of Genghis Khan comes primarily from archived Chinese and Persian documents Ratchnesvky, 1991. Genghis Khan ordered before his death that his body be eventually moved and placed in an unmarked and secret gravesite. There is some mention in translations from ancient Chinese archives about details of a mausoleum and ceremonial sites for worship prior to his body being removed to a secret location. After his death his wife ordered horse sacrifices be made to the gods every day for a year to honor her husband. There are recent geophysical expeditions undertaken in the Burkhan Kaldun mountains to search for possible lost grave sites. These studies use high resolution imagery and internet websites to statistically map interpretations made by the public as to possible locations of interest (Lin et al. 2011). There is some interest into what the ceremonial sites might have looked like and if they did exist, what the conditions were and what present day remains might be available for discovery. The original mausoleum may have housed his body before it was moved to an unmarked grave has been speculated. One candidate location that may have housed the mausoleum is the Avraga site near the village of Delgerhaan in Hentity Province. Avraga is believed to be the thirteenth century palace site of Genghis Khan. The location was discovered by researchers at the Niigata University, Kokugakuin University in Japan, and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. Excavations since 2001 revealed what are believed to be palace houses floors of Genghis Khan and one of his sons. One 25 m square platform excavated is believed to possibly be a mausoleum for Genghis   10.3  Jaboncillo Site, Manta Ecuador  193  Khan. The ruins were marked by cornerstones and pillar postholes. A 40 cm high stone wall along with surrounding fire marks and holes filled with ashes and bones around the platform were discovered. Excavation in the southern part of the mausoleum revealed incense burners with dragon designs that were considered the symbol of an emperor. The findings of the incense burners lends support to the description in a Persian history book of the fourteenth century that the grave of Genghis Khan is located within 12 km near the mausoleum. These findings are consistent with historical documents that described a memorial service for Genghis Khan involving animal sacrifices and incense burning on the surrounds of the mausoleum. These readings along with additional evidence of the existence of a double wall construction around the platform have led researchers to speculate that this is also a likely candidate for the mausoleum of Genghis Khan. Areas nearby the suspected mausoleum of Genghis Khan were surveyed with GPR to learn about the extent and nature of structures found from excavation. Some of the typical features which GPR has been able to clearly see are the flat stone floors and wall remnants that are shallowly buried at the site (Fig. 10.6). The thirteenth century dwellings in the Avraga Palace site were primarily constructed with flat stones. The walls were built with connected air passageways at their base. Fire pits on the outside the house were made adjacent to the wall foundations. Flews were embedded along the walls some distance from the external fire pits. The heat from the fire would be drawn into the narrow tunnels built into the walls and void spaces built below the stone floor, providing heating into the interior of the home. The exhaust would escape through flews built into the walls that went up through the roof. These early wall/floor heating designs are still the preferred heating arrangements in modern homes in Korean for example. At another location at Avraga that was surveyed with GPR revealed a complex pattern of subtle features with no regular orientation. On shallow feature imaged on a depth slice map shows a weak, partially round like anomaly with several linear extensions that was later excavated (Fig. 10.7). Soil removal just above the depth slice level indicated a collection of bones but with no charcoal or burnt remnants in the soil. This is not believed to have any ceremonial significance. Currently, the actual location of Genghis Khan’s grave is not known with any absolute certainty nor has it been discovered by remote sensing surveys. There are numerous sites postulated which may be likely candidates that still need to be investigated further. For the typical Mongolian however, there is no desire to find the site as they wish to honor their ancient ruler who wished to be left alone in his unmarked and secret burial.  10.3  Jaboncillo Site, Manta Ecuador  With contributions from Kent Schneider, US Forest Service, Agamemnon Pantel, Pantel del Cueto Associates, Pepe Ortiz, Polytechnic University Puerto Rico, Jorge Marcos, Guayaquil University, Ecuador.   194  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.6 Two shallow time slices made at the Avraga site in eastern Mongolia are shown. Several reflections are identified as an external fire pit (excavation picture – lower left), and the partial remains of house floor made of flat stones (excavation picture – upper right)  Outside of Manta Ecuador not far from the coast lies an area of at least 3,500 ha of destroyed Inca ruins. The geographical setting of Jaboncillo makes it a very unique area in that the ancient Incas in this area were able to manage water resources. The Incas were able to grow crops year round in the foothills below the Montecristi Mountain by careful water management, even though rain was quite sparse and the area considered arid for the amount of yearly rainfall. Jaboncillo was inundated by illicit pot hunters in the 1960 and 1970s who extracted many museum pieces and black market pottery of exquisite design. Many of the pots were purchased by state and private banks which also run museums and display their acquired antiquities. Many locations that have been robbed have much larger areas which were untouched by excavations as well as many sites still remaining undiscovered (personal communication Dr. Juerge Marcos and Dr. Pepe Ortiz, University of Guayaquil, Ecuador). The purpose of using GPR at several tests sites was to determine if this technology might be useful   10.3  Jaboncillo Site, Manta Ecuador  195  Fig. 10.7 One area that appeared to have compacted soils and a partial circular/curvilinear shape was excavated to reveal some soil staining and animal bones  to locate various subterranean features near and around Inca platform sites (Fig. 10.8) that may have been missed by earlier pot hunters. Some of the features that to be identified might include shallow graves as well as granaries. Shown in Fig. 10.9 is a time slice from 19 to 37 cm with an overlay of the surface stones from one Inca platform. The data were generated from parallel profiles collected at a 25 cm separation. The linear trends in some scattered rock features have similar parallel trends to some of the reflections anomalies. This may indicate   196  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.8 Photograph of a partially intact Inca platform ceremonial/house moud site, Jaboncillo, Ecuador. A photograph of an excavated grain silo found near the platform is shown  Fig. 10.9 A time slice made from 19 to 37 cm overlaid with preserved rock features of an Inca (ceremonial) platform is shown for the Jaboncillo site.  that GPR is able to see locations of missing erased platform structures by picking up subtle compacted floors or walls. Adjacent to several of the above ground rock walls are larger reflection anomalies. Seen near (24, 9 m) is a discreet round reflection which could be indicative of a buried silo located close to the house platform. Several reflections near (15, 15 m) also may also be related to   10.4  Presidio, San Francisco  197  Fig. 10.10 Photograph of the Presidio in San Francisco taken during the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training workshop in 2008  undiscovered grain silos. One silo excavated near the survey area shows them to be about 1.5 m on a side and quite deep from 2 to 4 m (Fig. 10.8). The GPR imagery is valuable in that it can lead the archaeologists to properly ration their financial resources devoted to excavation. Digging blind test pits at the site or perhaps the removal of several layers of top soil across the entire site to discover the tops of archaeological features such as silos would in general be prohibitive and not a wise use of resources to achieve more understanding of the site. GPR can increase the probability of discovering important structures that can yield valuable information that could be missed or even accidentally damaged by invasive excavation.  10.4  Presidio, San Francisco  With contributions from Bryan Haley, University of Mississippi and Dave Morgan, Southeast Archaeological Center, National Park Service. The Presidio in San Francisco was first established as a Spanish Fort in 1776 and later became a US military installation in 1847. During its history the Presidio served as a staging area for US military engagements in Asia as well as a refugee camp for San Francisco citizens that lost their residences in the great earthquake of 1906. One area of interest at the Presidio is the location of Pershing square, named after the famed General of the same name (Fig. 10.10). The area is designated as one possible location for a site museum.   198  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.11 A comparison of magnetic gradiometer, resistivity and GPR time slices made at the Presidio. The resistivity map show striking similarities with the shallow time slice maps (Tanaka et al. 2009)  However, before a site museum if approved or any other structure could be built a detailed survey of the area would be needed to assure that no important artifacts might exist at the site. Magnetic gradiometer, resistivity and GPR surveys were made at the Presidio in hopes of learning more details of the remnant subsurface structures (Fig. 10.11). Although the gradiometer survey was very sensitive to subsurface metal probably buried at the site, the resistivity maps shows remarkable similarities with the shallow time slice data. Sample excavation test pits were put in at the site based on an overlay of the relative-strongest-reflectors shown in Fig. 10.12. The overlay was generated from four time slice maps with a spatial thickness of 13 cm and generated between 14 and 59 cm The time slice amplitude maps were overlapped by 50 % between consecutive slices. The GPR survey on the   10.4  Presidio, San Francisco  199  Fig. 10.12 A shallow overlay time slice map from 14 to 59 cm along with excavation test pits made as several locations. In one area to the south, a rock lined foundation was discovered. An area south of a buried utility mapped at the site are believed to be the partially intact foundations from the razed home of General Pershing and nearby homes that were razed after the fire in 1915  site revealed numerous rectilinear features, some of which were excavated (Fig. 10.12). At one location old metal irrigation pipes were corroborated from the recorded reflection anomalies. The irrigation system on the resistivity maps are seen as the weaker reflection anomalies, but with complete traceability of the metal pipes across the site. At another location, a small juncture in a continuous reflection could be seen in the time slice map. This was excavated to reveal a rock lined foundation that also had a small corner or change in direction. This foundation is similar to those that once supported the house of General Pershing and nearby houses. During General Pershings’ travels into Mexico in the pursuit of capturing Pancho Villa, his wife and children were killed in a fire that consumed their home. The foundations were eventually paved over and a square erected on the site.   200  10  Case Histories  The remnant foundations of General Pershings home are believed to be slightly north of the foundations excavated but still within the survey grid. Remnant foundations from homes nearby his former home indicate these structures are still partially intact beneath the square according to information derived from the shallow time slice image along with the test excavation. Whether or not these findings are significant enough to redirect the location of a planned museum at the site was not known at the time of this writing.  10.5  Villa of Emperor Traianos: Rome (Italy)  With the contribution of A. M. Fiore (Soprintendenza Archeologica per Il Lazio, Roma, Italy). This work summarises the results of a research project funded by Soprintendenza Archeologica per il Lazio (Italian Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Heritage) and Institute for Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (ITABC-CNR) carried out in 1999–2001 (Piro et al. 2003). The aim of the project was the development of a method for combining the results of integrated geophysical prospection for creating a detailed archaeological interpretation. The selected archaeological site, situated on Altopiani di Arcinazzo (Roma), characterised by the presence of structures related to Traianos Villa, was carried out using highresolution GPR surveys along with high-resolution fluxgate differential magnetic (FDM) survey. The GPR surveys were carried out over two seasons at Altopiani di Arcinazzo between 1999 and 2001. The geologic situation and some preliminary excavations at the site suggested that a GPR survey could adequately map subsurface structures till several meters. The primary goal for doing a ground remote sensing survey of the site was to determine as much as possible about the location, shape and purpose of any buildings that could be identified from the survey. The images obtained from the survey would have a great utility for archaeologists that are planning many years of future excavations at the site. Prior knowledge of subsurface structures from the villa would have a great importance for the archaeologist in developing an excavation strategy as well as helping to effectively manage resources assigned for the excavation. The Traiano’s Villa, near the Affilani Mountains in central Italy, is the most inland of all the imperial villas located near Rome (Fig. 10.13). Because the villa is situated high in the mountains suggests that it was probably used for summer holidays and for hunting expeditions. The site was ascribed to be the Villa of Emperor Marco Ulpio Traiano (A.D. 98–117) after earlier archaeological excavations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The archaeological site, which is 55 km from Rome, could be easily reached during Roman times by the Valeria, Sublacensis, or the Prenestina roads. The buildings of the villa are located   10.5  Villa of Emperor Traianos: Rome (Italy)  201  Fig. 10.13 Location of the Villa of Emperor Traianos (A.D. 98–117)  on flat plateaus with dimensions of about 4–5 ha, and are supported laterally by walls with counter forts and niches (Fig. 10.14). The lower terrace to the villa has a rectangular dimension 105  35 m, and it is supported in the south by the walls with counterforts and in the north by the walls with niches. The central area of this terrace was probably occupied by a garden with an external portico. On the west corner of this lower terrace there are some buildings open to the public at the entrance to the villa which have undergone excavations from 1955 to 1985. The upper level of the villa is supported by walls over 200 m in length. Geologically the site is characterised by limestone formations of Miocene-age with a thickness of about 230 m. This formation is subject to karstic erosion processes which is exemplified by the strong fracturation (Palmieri and Zuppi 1977). The morphology of the area is strongly influenced by the tectonics, which have created a consistently NW-SE trending fracture and fault system across the region. The most important elements of the landscape associated with the karsterosion are the dolina, lapiez, and karren stratigraphic formations. Permeation of the area has been facilitated by the difference in height between the Altopiani area (high-plateau) and the sources of the Aniene river. In the North-East section of the Villa a spring-source that is present is fed by the Aniene river and arrives at the villa through fractures of Miocene-limestone basement. In this area a large rectangular cistern built in the Roman period is still present.   202  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.14 Photograph of excavations of the outside terrace wall at the Villa of Trainaos and site plans showing other exposed walls. The excavated areas represent less than 5 % of the total land comprising the villa  10.5.1 GPR Survey The Soprintendenza Archeologica per il Lazio jointly with ITABC-CNR, started in 1999 with a new integrated archaeological project with the aim to extend the research of 1955–1985 and to rescue this very important historical monument (Fiore and Mari 1999). GPR surveys were performed in November 1999, May 2000 and in May 2001 at seven areas A–G indicated in Fig. 10.15. For the measurements a GSSI SIR 10A+, which was one of the earliest digital radar system, along with a 300 and 500 MHz bistatic antenna with constant offset, were used in the survey (Piro et al. 2003). Single-fold exploratory reflection profiles were first carried out at the site with the following objectives: Preliminary identification of the targets Calibration of the instrument Selection of the optimum frequency antenna Analysis of the subsurface response as a function of the orientation of the profiles. The first GPR survey was concentrated on the upper terraces of the site in the eastern part of the area. Adjacent profiles at the site were collected alternatively in reversed and un-reversed directions across the survey grids. The horizontal spacing   10.5  Villa of Emperor Traianos: Rome (Italy)  203  Fig. 10.15 Location of the GPR surveys made at the Villa of Traianos  between parallel profiles at the site was 0.5 m. Radar reflections along the transects were recorded continuously across the ground at 80 scan s 1, with a stack ¼ 4. Along each profile, markers were spaced every 1 m to provide spatial reference. The data were later corrected for a variation in speed to a constant 32 scans per meter (or 1 scan per approximately 0.03 m). All radar reflections within 75 ns (twoway-travel time) time window were recorded digitally in the field as 8 bit data (in these early days) and 512 samples per radar scan. A nominal microwave velocity of about 6 cm ns 1 using an experimental profile collected over an area where the archaeologists accurately know the depth of a wall was used to convert from time to depth. A GPS survey, using a D-GPS Leica 520 in differential configuration, was made to position all the local grids into georeferenced ones.  10.5.2 Data Processing Time slice analysis was applied to all the surveyed grids at the Villa of Traiano. For the site A time slices were generated at 5 ns intervals, for the site C the time slices were computed at a thicker time window of 9 ns, while for the sites E–F and G the time-slices were generated at 4 ns intervals. The time slice data sets were computed from spatially averaging the squared amplitude of radar reflections in the   204  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.16 A 500 MHz time slice shown from the upper portion of site A at 28.4–33.5 ns (85–101 cm)  horizontal as well as the vertical. Horizontal averaging included creating spatial averages every 0.5 m along the radar transects (Goodman et al. 2002). The data were gridded using a Krigging algorithm that included a search of all data within a 1. m radius of the desired points to be interpolated on the grid. Thresholding and data transforms were used to enhance various features detected on the time slice maps (Piro et al. 2003). From the time slices it is possible to interpret structures in the eastern portion of the investigated area to be related to private domus or palatium of the villa. In Fig. 10.16 a time slice from 28 to 33 ns (85–101 cm) located over a portion of site A, in which the location of many walls, having different shapes, size and orientation could be clearly imaged. This area is characterised by the presence of many rooms, halls, corridors, exedrae and bathes associated with the private areas of the villa. Several mushroom shaped anomalies (identified in the Fig. 10.16) are seen which are believed to be dipping pools in the bathhouse. A group of quadrangular rooms, connected with each other and crossed by corridors, and semi-circular rooms were located with high resolution. These rooms were interpreted as thermal rooms (balnea). 23.1 ns: This level shows an oval feature believed to be a (moray) eel pond. Below the oval are weaker reflections from destroyed buildings that may predate   10.5  Villa of Emperor Traianos: Rome (Italy)  205  the villa. Also clearly seen although slightly lower in reflection strength is another partial oval like structure below the present oval. This may indicate backfilled and robbed wall trenches from a possible previous oval pond and/or villa at the site that may pre-date the Villa of Traianos. Large buildings detected on the eastern portion of the site probably house the military entourage for the emperor. 31.2 ns: This level shows a perfect rectangular solid structure which is believed to be an intact mosaic floor, about 7  12 m. 81 ns: At this depth level (about 2.5 m) a square structure with a round interior indicates that this reflection anomaly is most likely attributed to a Roman cistern. This interpretation is also verified by the suggested intact mosaic floor identified on the 31.2 ns time slice which is adjacent to the cistern. It is common for mosaic floors to be constructed at the household in front of the villa cistern. In Fig. 10.17 are time slices of the central section of the upper terrace of the villa. On the 23 ns time-slice map (69 cm) the area is characterised by the presence of two interesting structures. The westernmost feature shows an oval shaped structure which has been interpreted by the archaeologists as an eel fishpond. Roman emperors households were known to domesticate eels on their summer estates as was practiced by the wealthiest in the Roman empire. The moray eels were domesticated for food but were also fondly embraced as pets as well. Below this oval eel pond structure, square shaped rooms also become visible in the GPR time slices. These weaker structures below the strong oval anomaly indicate that they are probably older structures. The older – destroyed structures were probably robbed of their stonework and reused in the villa construction and then probably just backfilled with soil, accounting for the weaker reflections of these older features. The large structure, on the easternmost side of this area, shows a very big complex characterised by large rectangular rooms and corridors. The long rectangular corridor which contains many square shaped rooms has been interpreted as a criptoporticus. These buildings are postulated to be perhaps military complexes to protect the main part of the villa, where the emperor was at the next terrace up. An isosurface rendering of the stronger reflection features at the Villa of Traianos is shown in Fig. 10.18. The isosurface illuminated represents the 75th strongest reflecting surface recording in the 3D volume. A summary of some of the structures to date found at the Villa of Traianos is shown in Fig. 10.19. There are still more surveys to be arranged in the future as more than 7 ha of area are still left to be studied (Piro et al. 2003). In 2012, the Villa remains were cordoned off from the general public after the discoveries found with GPR showed the extent of the remains. The GPR reflection maps have helped the archaeologists to create a general vision of the layout of the Villa, which will be indispensable when future excavations and partial restorations are begun.   206  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.17 Time slices of the central section of the upper terrace at the Villa of Traianos   10.5  Villa of Emperor Traianos: Rome (Italy)  207  Fig. 10.18 Isosurface rendering of the strongest 75 % strongest reflection surfaces recorded at the eel pond at the Villa of Traianos  Fig. 10.19 Overlay of some of several of the GPR survey grids on the Villa of Traianos site map that were located with GPS   208  10.6  10  Case Histories  Forum Novum Site, Tiber Valley, Italy  With contributions by Helen Patterson, British School of Archaeology Rome and Vince Gaffney, University of Birmingham. Forum Novum – Vescovio lies in the Sabine hills to the northeast of Rome in Tiber Valley. Prior to geophysical remote sensing performed in the last 12 years, knowledge of the town was based on the rich epigraphic evidence (Filippi 1989), occasional references in the classical literary sources, and from limited excavations of part of the forum complex carried out by the Soprintendenza Archeologica per il Lazio during the early 1970s (Reggiani 1971–1974). As its name suggests, Forum Novum was a new Roman foundation, established as a forum or market sometime during the Republican period (Patterson et al. 2000). The Forum Novum town and marketplace were constructed in the first century B.C. in Italy’s Tiber Valley. The town flourished well into the fourth century A.D. and fell into disarray after the Lombard invasions (Gaffney et al. 2003–2004). At present, the ancient foundations of this town are below ground. In some locations differences in tonal patterns on aerial photographs have provided indications of the presence of subsurface buildings. The patterns which appear in agricultural fields are referred to as crop marks. These slight discoloration in the vegetation above buried walls, are caused by various materials leaching out of the buried walls and which eventually manifest themselves by slightly altering the color of the surface vegetation. Roman archaeologists can often map a site simply by reading aerial photographs, however, not all subsurface features are illuminated on the surface by crop marks. The Forum Novum is a good site example where shallow subsurface archaeology did not manifest itself on the top surface vegetation. From 1997 to 2001 a series of topographic and ground-based remote sensing surveys took place at Forum Novum which provides a basic map of the ancient centre. The topographic survey permitted standing monuments and contemporary features to be located within a common grid, while ground-remote sensing surveys allowed the identification of buried structures and features. Initially, the first geophysical surveys at the site were restricted to just magnetometry and resistivity. Much of the ancient town lay under modern structures such as a restaurant, bar, carparks, roads and the church of Santa Maria in Vescovio. Because of metallic noises as well as highly magnetic soils, many portions of the site were not suitable for magnetometry and resistivity. Therefore, it was clear from these initial surveys that, in order to understand the layout of the town itself, these techniques alone could not be used to fill in critical locations where surface material noises would restrict magnetic and resistivity findings. Beginning in 1998 high-resolution GPR surveys (conducted by ITABC-CNR in collaboration with British School at Rome) were applied over two areas to test the potential of this technique for resolving subsurface structures where magnetics and resistivity could not be effectively used. One of the advantages of GPR surveys is that it could be applied in conditions where it was impossible to use magnetometry   10.6  Forum Novum Site, Tiber Valley, Italy  209  and resistivity (for example tarmac and gravel surfaces), and secondly that it provides plans of the buried structures at different depths. Areas adjacent to this marketplace were surveyed with GPR in hopes of detecting buried structure associated with this complex. For the measurements, a GSSI SIR 10A+, equipped with a 300 and 500 MHz bistatic antenna with constant offset were employed. At each site radar profiles were collected alternatively in reversed and un-reversed directions across the survey grids. The horizontal spacing between parallel profiles at the site was 0.5 m. Radar reflections along transects were recorded continuously across the ground at 80 scan s 1, with a scan stack of 4. Fiduciary navigation markers were placed along each profile every 1 m to provide spatial reference. The data were later corrected for a variation in speed to constant 32 scans m 1. All radar reflections within 75–85 ns (two-way travel time) time window were recorded digitally in the field as 8 bit data and 512 samples per radar scan for the two antenna survey. Shown in Fig. 10.20 (after Goodman et al. 2004; Gaffney et al. 2003) are two time slice images from an area located next to the market place. In this time slice map a very shallow image of near surface reflections (0–7.8 ns) and a deeper image from about 50 cm (16.4–24.2 ns) depth are shown. In the shallow image various geometrical features can be seen: a circular feature with a central anomaly and a rectangular feature with round ends. The rounded rectangular feature is the known foundation of a destroyed mausoleum. The time slice image at the deeper 50 cm level shows a comparatively large oval structure. The recorded reflections are from a buried wall defining the inner boundary of an undiscovered amphitheatre. No crop marks on the surface of the site could be detected from aerial photographs indicating the presence of the destroyed urban amphitheatre. Excavation at one of the eight entrances leading into the amphitheatre shows a wall about 80 cm thick and buried at a depth of 50 cm (Fig. 10.20). The total depth of the standing wall below ground is 1.5 m. The amphitheatre could be dated to the late first century A.D. based on shards of pottery that were found near the excavated wall of one of the entrances. From the GPR records it could be determined that the amphitheatre seating was probably made of wood construction as no outer oval embankment wall was found. From the subsequent discovery of the amphitheatre, several of the geometric features imaged on the shallow time slice map, such as the round circle could be interpreted and are believed to be structures built for the training of gladiators (personal communication, Wolfgang Neubauer, University of Vienna). In another area just next to the reconstructed ruins, time slice images reveal many rectangular forms that are believed to be living quarters (Fig. 10.21, after Goodman et al. 2004). Corridors and doorways into rooms can be distinctly seen in the images. Increased levels of noise at greater depths (near 30–40 ns) suggest fallen wall materials are primarily recorded at these depths. It is interesting to note that the very top time slice shows a Y-shaped anomaly, which corresponds to two dirt roads, void of vegetation, coming together on the site. GPR can effectively see the ground surface conditions and translate this information into subtle amplitude changes recorded in the ground wave reflection. An area surveyed in the 2001 field season was north of the Forum Novum marketplace and church (Fig. 10.22). At this site two angular walls meeting at a   210  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.20 Two shallow time slices from the Forum Novum site are shown. The location one of the eight amphitheater entrance along with a photograph of the excavation unit is shown that were originally used for gladiator training. On a deeper slice from 15 ns (45 cm) an oval anomaly from an undiscovered amphitheatre with eight entrances was detected and later excavated   10.6  Forum Novum Site, Tiber Valley, Italy  211  Fig. 10.21 Four time slices made at consecutive 10 ns (30 cm) time windows at a dirt car park at the Forum Novum are presented. A Y-shaped road transecting the site is clearly imaged on the shallowest time slice map 0–10 ns. From 10–20 to 20–30 ns, buildings with well defined rooms, doorways into rooms and corridors were detected. From 30 to 40 ns, the subsurface building reflections are less intact and probably represent reflections from wall rubble  Fig. 10.22 Areas of Roman crypts, strong reflections from the floor of a destroyed bathhouse, and two long walls meeting at a semi-circular features were discovered from the GPR survey (Photographs of the excavated crypts found at the Forum Novum, courtesy of the Helen Patterson, British School of Archaeology Rome and Vince Gaffney, University of Birmingham, UK)   212  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.23 Overlay of several of the important GPR time slices images found at the Forum Novum during 1998–2001 field surveys  corner with a semi-circular wall feature was discovered. The long walls start from an area where a larger flat and strong reflection surface was mapped. This area is postulated to be from reflections of partially intact floors comprising a destroyed public bathhouse. The walls most likely encompassed a garden off the backside of the bathhouse. Several small rectangular structures mapped exterior to and flanking the southern wall were excavated to reveal fairly intact Roman crypts that were full of funerary items. Several other important structures were discovered at the Forum Novum site over a period of 3 years of field surveys (Fig. 10.23). In addition to the amphitheatre a large Roman villa containing an interior atrium and pond were discovered (initially from a complete magnetometer survey). Excavations at the villa revealed   10.7  Aiali, Grosseto: Italy  213  very shallow walls within 25 cm of the ground surface. The walls could not be seen clearly on the 2D radargrams since the ground wave interference was significant. Nonetheless, the time slice maps were able to easily distinguish the wall reflections from within the reverberating – ground surface waves. At another location between the church and the market place a 7 m square reflection anomaly that is hollow in the centre was found. This reflection feature is believed to be a remnant foundation, which would have supported a large monument to the Forum Novum. The quality of imaging results at the Forum Novum is another stunning example of the capabilities of GPR technology to accurately map large areas without any extensive excavation.  10.7  Aiali, Grosseto: Italy  With contributions from Stefano Campana, University of Siena. The place named Aiali is situated on lowland between the medieval town of Grosseto and the roman town of Roselle in the Tuscany region (Fig. 10.24). This site has been studied since 2006 employing different surveying methods including remote sensing satellite and aerial photography, field walking surveys and geophysical surveys (magnetic, resistivity, GPR) (Campana and Piro 2009). The main goals of the survey consisted of obtaining information about location, depth and dimensions of possible remains and providing interpretable information to archaeologists for characterizing the types of building that might be present. This site was also considered propitious for testing the potential of dense grid strategies as well as different 3d processing schemes over a complex Roman site.  Fig. 10.24 The Aiali site is composed of several agricultural fields which were studied with geophysical remote sensing equipment including GPR in 2006   214  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.25 GPR time slices for site B at Aiali  Data were recorded inside four areas (Fig. 10.24) at 50 cm profile spacing at Aiali. Once the basic raw radargrams were conditioned, the squared amplitude of the radar pulses were then averaged spatially every 25 cm along the profile and binned in time over 6 ns time windows. Consecutive time slices were generated at 50 % overlap between adjacent levels to better show transitions of the reflection anomalies (Goodman and Piro 2009). The survey at site B indicates the presence of some Roman buildings beneath this area (Fig. 10.25). Because the GPR results are less definitive on the building structure designs in this location, map indicate that the ancient buildings in this area have less integrity and are much less intact due to agricultural activity on the site. GPR time slice images for the combined site CD are shown in (Fig. 10.26). Shallow time slices indicate that the reflections to the tops of wall of a destroyed Roman villa are quite shallow and begin to appear on the third slice that is from 17 to 34 cm below the ground surface. A utility pipe that crosses the site can be identified by a faint linear reflection in a deeper slice from 43 to 60 cm. An overlay analysis of the site using all the time slice information from 17 to 112 cm (skipping   10.7  Aiali, Grosseto: Italy  215  Fig. 10.26 The complete time slice dataset computed the Aiali site. A nominal velocity of 7 cm/ns was used to convert the time slices to estimated depth slices  the top surface information) is shown in Fig. 10.27. The overlay image is shown along with one background filtered radargrams indicating the strong – reverberating wall reflections that were recorded. Because the wall reflections have a strong contrast with the surrounding areas, an isosurface amplitude render showing shapes of the remnant wall structures of the destroyed villa could be created (Fig. 10.28). For the Aiali site, the GPR survey results along with those made from other remote sensing methods, will be able to assist the archaeologists in reconstructing and preserving the “digital” knowledge of the site. Whether or not the site will be delineated as an important archaeological monument and the lands acquired from the farmers to prevent further destruction, is left for future generations to determine.   216  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.27 Overlay analysis showing all the reflectors from 40 to 81 cm along with an example background filtered radargram showing the strong wall reflections from the destroyed and buried foundations of the villa (after Goodman and Piro, 2009)   10.8  Palatino Hill: Forum Roma – Italy  217  Fig. 10.28 Isosurface rendering of all the reflection greater than 40 % the peak response recorded in the volume for the destroyed Roman villa discovered at the Aiali site  10.8  Palatino Hill: Forum Roma – Italy  With contributions of C. Panella, Department of Archaeology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. Archaeological excavations made subsequent to the geophysical surveys, from 2001 to 2004, between the northeast foot of Palatino Hill, the Colosseum Valley and nearest Elagabalo’s Thermae in the heart of Rome, a sequence of complex buildings related to the Roman period between the late Republican and Severo’s age were discovered (Piro and Panella, 2005). The oldest building is a domus of the late Republican period located in front of a line of buildings called tabernae which were used for shops and living quarters. This corridor of buildings connected the Colosseum Valley and the Roman Forum. The fire-raising of 64 A.D., signed the destruction of these buildings and the development of Neronian urbanism. The archaeological excavations have located a portion of the foundation of a portico, and a portion of a sewerage system with S-N direction and a foundation with E shape, which defines and encloses Elagabalo’s Thermae. Prior to the GPR surveys, structures determined from excavations were forward modelled using GPRSIM simulation software (Fig. 10.29). The complex structures in the area modelled had walls, pavements and various archaeological layers all overlapping in depth, translating into very complex radar patterns as well. The forward models indicated that distinguishing individual details of the complex structures might be overwhelming. Nonetheless, the simulations suggest that the strongest reflection features from the tops of structures could be effectively detected and imaged with GPR. GPR surveys were performed, during 2001–2004 at selected areas on the northeast foot of Palatino Hill. A total of 243, GPR profiles were collected at 0.5 m separations employing a SIR10Aþ GPR system (GSSI) equipped with a 500 MHz antenna and 70 MHz antenna (Subecho Radar) with the aim to extrapolate information obtained from excavations at the site. All radar reflections within a 100   218  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.29 Forward modelling simulation of a complex structure containing walls, pavements and various archaeological structures, implemented from known profiles determined excavations at the Palatino Hill, Rome  and 145 ns time window were recorded with the two different antenna. The data were gridded using a Krigging interpolation algorithm that included a search of all binned data within a 0.75 m radius of the desired point to be interpolated on the grid. Background filtering was used to remove line noises that were found to exist in the raw unprocessed images. Using the processed radargrams, interpolated and solid 3d volumes of squared reflections amplitudes were generated (Fig. 10.30). To synthesize all the important reflections into a single – comprehensive – image, overlay analysis from the ground surface down to 236 cm was implemented using all the upper slices. Shown in Fig. 10.31 is an overlay image of all the important relative-strongest-reflectors collected from shallow to deep horizons. Several anomalies can be traced continuously using the overlay image which may help archaeologists to understand contiguous structures. A roughly horizontal trending wall, embedded in between many strong reflection, can be seen trending along the line y ¼ 12 m. Overlay analysis is particularly useful in placing features that may be at different depths onto a single 2d image, whereas visualization and individual thin slices near this depth region would show the incomplete continuity of the buried – non-level – linear structures. GPR site plans, together with information on the geomorphology and on the archaeology of the site including the location, depth, size and vertical overlapping of the buried buildings were effectively estimated at another location at Palatino Hill. One time slice made at a depth of 1.9 m shows several linear feature (Fig. 10.32). Recent archaeological excavation (by Prof. Clementina Panella – Sapienza University of Roma) have confirmed these imaged features as being Noeronian period walls (discovered at excavations USM 5008 and USM 5045).   10.8  Palatino Hill: Forum Roma – Italy  Fig. 10.30 Time slice at 91 cm generated for a site on the northeast foot of the Palatino Hill. A continuous wall structure, partially discovered in archaeological excavations could be extrapolated and traced in unexcavated areas in the GPR survey grid  Fig. 10.31 Overlay analysis image of all the relative-strongest-reflectors from 0 to 236 cm  219   220  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.32 Several wall structures at another location at the Palatino Hill were identified on the GPR time slice record were later verified by direct archaeological excavations  10.9  Aquinum Roman Site (Castrocielo, Frosinone, Italy)  With contribution of G. Ceraudo, University of Salento (Lecce, Italy) and D. Zamuner (ITABC-CNR, Rome, Italy). This study is part of the Ager Aquinas Project, jointly developed between the University of Lecce (Department of Cultural Heritage – Laboratory of Ancient Topography and Photogrammetry), the Municipality of Castrocielo (Frosinone), the Province of Frosinone and the Institute of Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (ITABC-CNR). The archaeological site of Aquinum was identified from 1998 through the interpretation of oblique aerial photographs showing distinctive archaeological crop marks. Ancient Aquinum is characterised by two distinctive structures. The first is the presence of a very significant defence system with large walls and wide ditches; the second characteristic is the presence of a regular – but not orthogonal – road system of the town, bordered by an unusual parallelogram shape of the town blocks. Most of Aquinum today is composed of cultivated terrains and is full of farms and modern buildings. Only the central portion of the archaeological site, as the selected sector under the study named S. Pietro Vetere (property of Castrocielo Municipality) is characterised by grassy terrain and is free of constructions. Geologically the bedrock in the area is characterised by a series of travertine with a total   10.9  Aquinum Roman Site (Castrocielo, Frosinone, Italy)  221  Fig. 10.33 Aquinum (Castrocielo, Frosinone). An aerial photo of one area at the Aquinum site along with an interpretation map of the main archaeological structures is shown. The arrows indicate the investigated area, the ancient wall system and some of the main roads that have been discovered  layer thickness of about 15–18 m. These units lie on a series of Miocene-Pliocene sand and clay sediments. At the ground surface the travertine series are covered with a layer of topsoil between 0.3 and 0.5 m in thickness. With the results obtained after researching of the first aerial datasets and fieldwalking surveys, it was possible to reconstruct the town and the main road systems. Located in different portions of the studied area, the remains of some ancient buildings including a theatre, capitolium, and an amphitheatre could be mapped. It was possible also to reconstruct the particular shape of the urban-planning and some community blocks (Fig. 10.33). Although the analysis of the air photo evidences allowed the global interpretation of the site, it was not possible to reconstruct the entire subsurface archaeological record in the central portion of the town north of the theatre. The field project during the 2008 field season, started with new acquisition and interpretation of aerial photos, field-walking surveys and extensive geophysical surveys (GPR and fluxgate differential magnetic surveys) with the aim to better define the urban plan of the central portion of the ancient town (Piro et al. 2011). After extended interpretation of newly collected datasets archaeologists focused their attention on the S. Pietro Vetere area (property of Castrocielo Municipality). This area is characterised by the presence of some isolated buildings which are located very close to the main road system. A high-resolution survey was adopted with the aim to reconstruct a global vision of the investigated area using the   222  10  Case Histories  Fig. 10.34 Aquinum (Castrocielo, Frosinone). GPR slices, in the time window 17–19 ns, corresponding to the estimated depth 0.60–0.67 m are shown. The arrows indicate some clear reflections, interpreted as: (a) w1–w6, possible wall remains with variable dimensions in length; (b) R1–R2 portions of the ancient roads detected (R1 with averaged dimension of 50 m in length and 4.5 m in width) and (c) an isolated circular anomaly C1 with a diameter of about 11 m. AR symbol and black arrows indicate the location of observed ancient roads, mapped from aerial photographs  subsurface site plans from GPR. GPR surveys with a 500 MHz antenna were first performed during October 2008 and from February till April 2009, with a total coverage of 5 ha (Piro et al. 2011). Single-fold exploratory profiles were carried out at the site with the objectives of preliminary identification of the reflection targets and analysis of the subsurface response as a function of the orientation of the profiles. A total of 2,125 adjacent profiles across the site were collected at 0.5 m spacing in forward and reversed directions (zigzag) across the grids using a survey wheel. Slippage of the survey wheel was accommodated on the site by artificially tagging the total scans across the radargrams equidistantly based on the known length of the radar profiles. This assumes that slippage, over the rough agricultural surface, is constant along the individual radargrams. All radar reflections within the 65 ns time window were recorded. Because access to the site was controlled by the local farming activities, the site had to be subdivided   10.9  Aquinum Roman Site (Castrocielo, Frosinone, Italy)  223  Fig. 10.35 Aquinum (Castrocielo, Frosinone). Southern portion of S. Pietro Vetere area. Details of the archaeological survey overlapped on a portion of GPR slice at the estimated depth of 0.60–0.67 m. Picture of the discovered rooms after the first excavation, summer 2009  into many temporary accessible areas during the course of the surveys, which also experienced many different ground conditions day-to-day. Mosaic correction procedures were employed to achieve better matching of the edges and overall reflections between the sub-grid blocks. One GPR time slice from 17 to 19 ns, corresponding to an estimated depth range of 0.60–0.67 m is shown (Fig. 10.34). This depth slice represents a portion of all investigated surfaces in the selected area. Some of the clearest reflectors are indicated with the blue-arrows. It is possible to observe different individuated structures that have been interpreted with the help of the archaeologists, as walls and foundations of rooms and buildings that are still preserved in the ground. At an estimated depth of 0.67 m in the southern part of the studied area (Fig. 10.34) the amplitude slice shows the presence of buried buildings that were not observable on the aerial photo interpretation. This is the reason why archaeologists have focused their attention in this area with the first excavation tests made during 2009 and 2010, on two limited sectors (A1–A2, Fig. 10.35). The first excavated area A comprised of 100 m2 is characterised by the presence of an east–west oriented wall (made in opus reticolatum), and visible for a length of about 9 m. The second area A2, located north of A1, had extensive excavations totalling 400 m2. In this area where the GPR maps showed subsurface wall remains, archaeological excavations revealed portions of buried buildings that   224  10  Case Histories  could be interpreted as a public bath. The central room has a trapezoidal plan and a total floor area of 20 m2 with north–south oriented. This feature is identified as an ancient Caldarium which was a warm room heated with hot air circulating below the floor as well as behind the walls. Other square and smaller heat rooms with an average dimension of 6 m inside the thermal building were found in southern areas; while north of this area smaller room dimensions of only 2.5 m were discovered. The eastern area is characterised by the presence of tessellated paving, which has been interpreted as an Apodyterium – undressing room (Fig. 10.35) Piro et al. 2011.  10.10  Cambodia: Shra Shrang Temple  With contributions from Yasushi Nishimura, Nara National Cultural Properties Research Institute. Just to the east entrance of the The Banteay Kidei Temple which is part of the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia, is the Srah Srang Royal Bath Basin. The large man made water body was constructed in the mid-tenth century by initiative of Kavindraimathana and later modified near 1200 by Jayavarman VII using laterite blocks that are found in the area. A multi-tiered landing platform on the west edge of the baray is adorned with naga balustrades and has lion statues guarding the platforms overlooking the manmade baray. An island temple built in the Srah Srang Baray show sparse remains of an island temple that can be exposed in the middle of the lake during the dry season when the water is low. The purpose of the baray is not exactly known but is believed to have both spiritual and/or purposes for agricultural production. The spiritual context, because of the expansive size may indicate that the baray construction represents the seas surrounding Mount Meru for the Hidu Cosmos. The Srah Srang is much smaller than the East and West Barray in Angkor which are more than 5  1.5 miles. The later reconstructions in the twelfth century may have been necessary because of the use of inferior sandstone blocks that quickly deteriorated. Laterites are formed from soils that are rich in iron and aluminum and usually are found in tropical areas. The weathering process takes time and determines the quality and strength of the laterites for building. Laterite proved to be an important material for building and rebuilding many temple and monument foundations in Angkor. French archaeologists (Courbin 1988) had done searches in Srah Srang looking for a suspected necropolis. Some excavations revealed unknown baray wall foundations. Written documents of the results of excavations however were lost during years of civil war. Verbal recollections were documented regarding some of the important information lost from the destroyed reports. In one particular discussion, knowledge of a wall near the lion guardians overlooking the Srah Srang Royal Bath Basin was believed to exist although no written documentation was available. A GPR survey was expedited to rediscover a lost wall that was believed to exist near the outside moat of the baray. Using radar profiles collected with a 300 MHz   10.10  Cambodia: Shra Shrang Temple  225  Fig. 10.36 1998 GPR survey results at the Srah Srang Royal Bath Basin, Siem Reap, Angkor, Cambodia. A subsurface wall bordering the twelfth century bath basin was rediscovered with GPR  antenna at 1 m separation, time slices were generated (Fig. 10.36). In a depth slice from 78 to 117 cm a linear feature believed to be the lost wall once described by French archaeologists was imaged. Extensive GPR surveys by Till Sonneman (Angkor Underground, Ph.D. Dissertation, 2011, University of Sydney) have been carried out at many locations throughout Angkor in the last 4 years. His research has been successful in mapping buried drainage features associated with the Cambodian barays. GPR is perfectly suited to discovering lost foundations and structures as well as for mapping earthen works and canals at many of the temples comprising the Angkor complex. GPR will   226  10  Case Histories  continue to be used by archaeologists in Cambodia that see the need for identification of the subsurface through remote sensing, as well as a tool to assist in understanding large areas which cannot be completely sampled by direct excavation.

Efforts to fuse GPR with resistivity, magnetics and conductivity survey data for instance, may help to provide further verification and confidence of site interpretation than could be obtained from just a single geophysical tool (Kvamme 2006). Integration with laser scanning and insertion of GPR volumes will dramatically assist in the interpretation of sites while viewing the real 3D context of the subsurface images. Recent work by several researches with laser scanning on sites along with integration of GPR have been done at the Trail of Tears in Alabama as well as other archaeological and engineering sites. An example of complete laser scanning of a site with co-location of the GPR data volume is shown Fig. 1. The ability to see GPR data in its real 3d context will make the validity of interpretation much clearer. Along these lines, as vector imaging with GPR becomes more common in the future, the true orientation of recorded radar scans will necessitate that accelerometers become common standard equipment in the future generation of equipment. Projecting the radar scan into their absolute correct positions in 3d space will allow for more accuracy are correctness in the subsurface images particularly when the data are also projected with laser scanning datasets. Even with the improvements and the deployment of full resolution imaging on the ground, GPR is still not the perfect technology and many archaeologists will never have adequate reason to employ it in their research. Archaeologists for instance working at sites where Neolithic or stone age lithic materials are desired for detection, would need 3d GPR volumes with sub-centimeter resolution to solve subsurface archaeological problems – GPR simply cannot deliver this resolution in its present form. GPR as we know it today will probably never be able to give subcentimeter accuracy at depths of 2 m for instance with the current pulse radar systems being employed. There will continue to be engineering improvements to the current GPR pulse radar systems as well as improved antenna technology. These “advances” along with application of more robust software and integration of advanced post processing routines, will help to tweak more information from the true ground structures. However, the current technology will have its limits – and D. Goodman and S. Piro, GPR Remote Sensing in Archaeology, Geotechnologies and the Environment 9, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31857-3, # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013  229   230  Remarks  Fig. 1 3D laser scanning of a site in Georgia along with the co-located GPR data volume (Data courtesy of Kent Schneider, US Forest Service and Land Air Surveys, Georgia)  leaps and bounds with single fold GPR systems will not make a dent in the next evolutionary leap needed to increase resolution of the subsurface. The “ultra-radar” device perhaps manufactured from a continuous wave – phased array radar system, and a true 3d imaging device (not just the “simple” full resolution that we can achieve with hi-density collection from standard pulse radar systems), may hold some potential to help the next generation of GPR evolution. Lutz and Perroud (2006) showed that directing the electromagnetic wave with array of closely spaced antenna that are properly phased can achieve higher spatial resolution as well as greater penetration depth. Their tests were made with 100 MHz antennas. Archaeologists would need more than an order magnitude change in the central frequency of a phased array system to get to even get close to the desired resolution of sub-centimeter. There have been discussions and developments of phased array radar systems for over 20 years now, but as yet no designs have made it to the commercial world or proven to work significantly beyond the current technology. The beauty of a phased array system is that the geophysicist would no longer be “needed”. The electronics in the ultra-radar-phased-array device, would generate 3d volumes all on its own electronically by focusing the radar beam from the array on each element in the cube to record reflections. The volume would not need any migration or other geophysical signal processing since the electronics and phasing of the elements alleviates the need for further processing. The promise is there for phased arrays to provide the much better resolution that might even allow for GPR’s predecessor to be used in medical imaging.
